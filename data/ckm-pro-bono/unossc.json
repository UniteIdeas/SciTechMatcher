    "abstract": "Despite persistent economic growth around the world, food and social insecurity, unemployment and poor housing remain pressing problems in many parts of Africa, especially in and around the major urban centres. For example, urban statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimate that approximately 800 million people are unable to obtain an adequate and secure supply of food year round. In this context, urban agriculture offers the potential to address both socioeconomic and environmental problems by providing alternative-livelihood strategies that also create a potentially sustainable way of dealing with urban organic waste. Both the nature of the problems and the role of urban agriculture as a solution are common across all Africa, indeed much of the developing world. In this context, Malawi is typical. Thus, there was justification for carrying out this research in Malawi, a country that is leading internationally in urbanization rates caused by rural-urban migration. Urban poverty and environmental degradation are closely related problems that plague the developing world. Compounding these problems, tools developed to aid national and international development (such as rapid rural appraisal and sustainable livelihoods) are not directly relevant to urban areas. The academic research through Case Study A was undertaken to address this gap by proposing a framework through which urban agriculture can be used to tackle urban poverty and subsequent envi ronmental problems. This empirical work gave rise to a conceptual framework (fig. 1) modelled on work by Parkes  (Parkes  2003; Parkes et al., 2003) that defines the boundaries of the system (prism) and conceptualizes urban poverty as being a function of social and ecosystem health as well as being influenced by socioeconomic and institutional forces. Urban agriculture has the potential to sit at the centre of this system and can, theoretically, be a tool whereby social and institutional forces can improve socioeconomic and environmental health. The second component is the three intersecting circles (a Venn diagram). These suggest that to target urban agricultural activities, it is necessary to analyse all aspects of the conceptual space defined by the prism. Specifically, this provides a way of framing the problems of urban poverty so that policymakers can conceptualize key development activities. Figure 1. Venn-prism conceptual framework. Researchers at the University of Malawi, in collaboration with experts from Leeds University in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, argued that urban agriculture based on the Venn-prism framework could create a link between the community and its ecosystem while at the same time reducing poverty (thus improving socioeconomic determinants) and potentially improving environmental determinants if it were officially recognized by institutions and undertaken to achieve sustainability (without exploiting or degrading the urban environment/ecology) at both the national Socioeconomic health Employment, food security, incomes, assets, better services Institutional forces Policies, strategies, organizations, funding Environmental health Better houses, clean air, natural resource mgmt.

For example, in Lilongwe, women are supported with financial resources to construct ecosanitation (ecosan) toilets to access humanure for food production. This has not only improved soil quality but it has also reduced water-borne related diseases, saved space for temporary toilets and improved community health and sanitation. At the institutional level, the City Council is able to engage non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in disseminating awareness messages on waste management and urban food systems. cent (539,000) in 1977 to 10.7 per cent (853,390) in 1987 to 14 per cent in 1998 (1,435,436), a level projected to increase to about 3.8 million in 2020. In 2005, the Government of Malawi reported that about 25.5 per cent of the poor population lived in urban areas (cities and municipalities), of whom 22.3 per cent were ultra poor. This urban poverty has several social implications including prostitution, child labour (fig. 2), insecurity and lack of basic amenities. Figure 2.

Rapid urbanization in Malawi is not associated with the commensurate economic growth and effective redistributive measures required to alleviate poverty. Instead, the result is increasing urban poverty whose most visible manifestation",

    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 21 per cent of the population of Argentina has no access to a water supply or sanitation and 52 per cent of the people do not have access to a sewage system. The lack of safe drinking water in some places in Argentina, such as isolated rural regions as well as peri-urban settlements not connected to the public water network, is dramatic. In the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin, a wide industrial zone on the periphery of the city of Buenos Aires that influences more than 5 million people, 35 per cent of the population has no access to potable (drinking) water. Poverty, malnutrition and poor quality of life are major issues there. Water contamination from industrial wastes such as heavy metals and hydrocarbons is of great concern. Arsenic is another important natural pollutant present in groundwater used for drinking purposes. The high cost of conventional treatments means that the development of simple, efficient and economical technologies for households or for small communities comprising five or six families is essential in the interim; this would palliate morbidity and mortality until the problem is really solved by the authorities. For this purpose, the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) and the National University of General San Martín (UNSAM), in collaboration with the Organization of American States (OAS) and Science and Technology for Development (CYTED, Spain), aimed to develop and disseminate three low-cost solar technologies that households could utilize using plastic bottles of soft drinks or mineral water. The project was tried initially in six countries in Latin America and the Caribbean – Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago – all countries with large amounts of solar radiation. Later, more campaigns were developed in other localities of several Latin American countries. The three technologies developed were solar disinfection (SODIS), where the combination of ultraviolet A and infrared radiation renders bacteria and viruses inactive; modified solar oxidation and removal of arsenic (SORAS), in which arsenic (As) removal is achieved by exposing water to solar light together with a piece of iron and drops of lemon juice; and solar heterogeneous photocatalysis (SHP), where the bottle is covered with an internal thin layer of titanium dioxide (TiO2), allowing the simultaneous removal of organic pollutants, toxic metals, arsenic and microbiological contamination. The project was successful and was twice awarded the MERCOSUR Award for Science and Technology (in 2006 and in 2011). Now, its application, which will also include public health institutions and NGOs, will begin in small settlements on the periphery of Buenos Aires in the industrial zone of the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin and in other peri-urban and rural localities.",

    "abstract": "India, with a population of more than one billion, is the world’s second-most-populated country. If present trends continue, India will overtake China as the country with the largest population by 2035. About 30 per cent of India’s population (more than 300 million) lives in cities. The country has experienced rapid population growth, and if present trends continue, more than half of all Indians will be urban dwellers in 2020 and over 30 per cent of urban dwellers will be slum dwellers and squatters. Indeed, with so many people, it is hardly surprising that India produces 42 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) every year. The problem is that collection efficiency ranges between 50 and 90 per cent of the waste generated, and as India’s population continues to grow, so will its MSW generation. 55 At present, MSW management is still a serious problem in most of the cities in India. Only a fraction of the wastes generated are collected, and those that are collected are disposed of in open dumps on the outskirts of cities. Sanitary landfills are practically non-existent in India except for a few that have recently been constructed. Insufficient collection and inadequate disposal create pollution problems, such as the emission of methane gas (which contributes to global warming), and pose risks to human health and the environment. The country’s urbanization and population growth tend to contribute to further deterioration of this situation. The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), is dedicated to environmental science and engineering for sustainable development, with the aim of providing innovative and effective solutions to environmental and natural resource problems. One of its goals is to improve solid waste management in Indian cities by examining recent experiences in various urban areas and using them as models to improve MSW management. In many of the cities, an integrated approach for MSW management is being planned by incorporating various techniques of waste management, which in turn leads to improvement in the system. Other municipalities are successfully replicating the same models. The failure of some methods applied by a city, the lessons learned, and the precautions taken in adopting new MSW technologies in other cities were analysed by NEERI for this project.",

    "abstract": "According to the 2012 National Housing and Population Census, Kampala, the capital of Uganda, has a population of more than 1.7 million, of whom about 1.35 million live in slums and face deplorable water and environmental problems. These informal slum settlements cover up to 25 per cent of the total area of the city and have no access to clean and safe piped water; access to water is restricted to unhygienic and highly contaminated sources. Inadequate sanitation and unclean water are key indicators of urban poverty. The population in the peripheral area of Kampala is affected by a lack of access to improved sanitation facilities, sanitation-related diseases and polluted water sources that often have devastating social, economic and environmental effects on all urban residents. There is a high prevalence of sanitation-related diseases such as diarrhoea and worm infestations and malaria is also endemic. Researchers at Bugema University aimed to develop ecological sanitation (ecosan) as a water and environmental conservation technology for the slum communities in Kampala. The increasing density of population in these slums and the swampy geological nature of Kampala mean that the use of pit latrines and flush toilets alone cannot provide city dwellers with a clean and hygienic environment. Dry (ecosan) toilets are thus considered a viable option. Unfortunately, there are other hypothetical problems relating to socioeconomics and attitudes of the intended users. This study was therefore conceptualized with the aim of exploring the potential of ecosan technologies as alternative environmental sanitation technologies for the slum dwellers in Kampala. It was anticipated that after the study, the city authority would take advantage of this opportunity and explore the use of ecosan within the high-density slum areas of the city. Unfortunately, however, since there has been no follow-up or policy dialogue and engagement to date, the opportunity has never been exploited. The missing link of dissemination/policy dialogue therefore needs to be addressed.",

    "abstract": "The Mexico City Metropolitan Area is the second-largest urban centre in the world after the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Its 20.1 million inhabitants represent around 18 per cent of the country’s population and the region produces 35 per cent of the national gross domestic product (GDP). As a result of such an urbanized area, air pollution is a major problem in Mexico City, with internal combustion engines responsible for around 61 per cent of the air pollution in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. They also generate 44 per cent of the area’s equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2eq) emissions, which contribute to the greenhouse effect and therefore to climate change. In  2002, the Mexico City government embarked on a World Bank/Global Environment Facility (GEF) project, “Introduction of Climate-friendly Measures in the Transport Sector in the Mexico Valley Metropolitan Area”, which called for developing a transport system based on confined, bus-only lanes. With funding from GEF, the Government of Japan, the Shell Foundation via EMBARQ (the Center for Sustainable Transport of the World Resources Institute) and the Mexico City government, the project organizers assembled a $9.5 million finance pool and began the Metrobus project with a strong environmental focus. The environmental orientation of the project enabled it to form part of Mexico City’s first Local Climate Change Action Strategy. The benefits of the Metrobus project, a bus rapid transportation (BRT) system designed to replace the old buses and microbuses, are numerous. From the user’s point of view, it means shorter travel time and safer travel. From the point of view of the Mexico City government, it means the increase in both efficiency and control over public transport, fast and inexpensive infrastructure construction compared to that for metro systems, improved road safety and a reduction in accidents. For the owners of transport concessions, it means evolution into an official business model, better relations with drivers and security of incomes. From the drivers’ point of view, it means job security and better working conditions. Finally, from a social viewpoint, it means an improvement in the city’s image, a reduction in local and greenhouse gas emissions, and mobility improvement. In 2005, the first Metrobus line started running. Since then, four lines have been put in place in Mexico City that transport around 800,000 passengers per day, five cities in the country have similar transport systems and nearly 20 more are planning to develop one.",

    "abstract": "Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh and the country’s largest city, with a population of more than 12 million. As is the case with many cities worldwide, rapid population growth and urbanization of a city that has an inadequate infrastructure are causing a major traffic congestion problem. Dhaka is known as the Rickshaw Capital of the World, with approximately 400,000 cycle rickshaws on the roads every day. Cycle rickshaws battle for space with buses, cars, pedestrians, taxis, three-wheelers and trucks. Since all moved at different speeds, the result was problematic, with lengthy traffic jams and daily gridlocks. Slow-moving rickshaws, for example, forced motorized vehicles to reduce their average speed from 15 kilometres per hour to just 9 kilometres per hour. In an effort to alleviate traffic congestion in Dhaka, the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) aimed to develop a project that would separate the motorized vehicles from the non-motorized traffic on major streets. A separate dividing wall of concrete was built to segregate the non-motorized traffic such as bicycles, rickshaws and the three-wheelers in order to enable the rest of the traffic to move faster and to reduce the number of accidents and collisions. With the non-motorized means of transport in another lane, the average speed of motorized vehicles increased to 13 kilometres per hour and traffic congestion decreased in some major intersections.",

    "abstract": "Non-technical Summary of the Main Features of the Project As governments around the world are tackling issues relating to poverty, partnerships in which private firms or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) become directly involved in implementing public development projects have become increasingly common. Such involvement gives these organizations a chance to take part in more large-scale projects, thus gaining experience and legitimacy that they would not necessarily gain when confined to small-scale activities. These organizations may also bring a flexibility and freshness that make them more innovative than more established, larger organizations whether NGOs or the public sector. Small NGOs, however, are not necessarily equipped to serve as partners in more complex management contexts. The present paper looks at the experience of the Work on Housing Programme (WHP) in Recife, Brazil, that was begun in 2002. The WHP recruited NGOs to participate in a special programme aimed at improving housing for low-income communities in the city. The NGOs implemented the project under the coordination of the Science, Technology and Economic Development Secretariat. The WHP objectives included: (a) building affordable houses; (b) training individuals to enter the civil construction work market; (c) providing a temporary income for those involved in the training activities; and (d) strengthening self-esteem and citizenship awareness in low-income communities. The WHP was regarded as a model for how NGOs could work with the public sector to reduce poverty. The case study presents an evaluation of the degree to which the initial goals were realized and an analysis of the lessons to be learned. It also includes a discussion of the importance of the organizational autonomy of the NGOs in financial relationships with government agencies, the problem of maintaining adequate flexibility, and the meeting of the managerial challenges that come with being involved in largescale projects.",

    "abstract": "The Indian economy is booming and the transportation sector is expanding very fast. It is estimated that 70 per cent of the goods transportation in India is carried by road. With an estimated 20 million heavy, medium and light vehicles on the road, there is a huge driver population. Driving a commercial vehicle in India is very difficult and provides a meagre income for the drivers, most of whom either are illiterate or have had only a primary education. They are able to reach home only once or twice a month and spend most of their time on the road. They need to drive continuously in extreme weather/rough conditions since most of the vehicles are not air-conditioned. Poor vehicle condition also adversely affects their on-road performance. Owing to such difficult conditions and the non-availability of a structured training/awareness programme, most of the drivers tend to commit a number of mistakes on the road. ACE Driving and Road Safety Education Pvt. Ltd. has initiated defensive-driving training programmes in India. The programmes are aimed at educating the illiterate drivers about the growing benefits of defensive driving for oneself, society and the overall transportation system in general. The programmes are classroom sessions/open-air discussions with commercial drivers who drive more than 10 to 12 hours daily. They are meant to educate the illiterate drivers about the finer aspects of defensive driving. Topics such as drinking and driving, tiredness and fatigue, following the traffic rules, AIDS awareness, and the attitude of a safe driver such as patience, confidence, anticipation and concentration while driving are explained in great detail. In addition, separate programmes are conducted for drivers of heavy vehicles carrying hazardous goods such as petroleum products. Some of the key points of such driver training are as follows. The programme: • isaimedspecificallyatdriversofheavyandmediumvehicles; • isconductedinthelocaldialectforeasyandconvenientunderstandingofthetopics; • issupportedbyfilmsandone-on-onediscussionsonthesubject; • iscreatedsoastoensuremaximumparticipationofeverydriver; • includessomeofthekeybenefitssuchasreducingfuelconsumptionandcon       trollingthepollutionontheroad;and • highlightsthespecificdrivingconcernsandmistakescommittedbythedrivers.

The vast majority of Venezuelans (about 85 per cent of the population) live in the cities of the north, especially in the capital, Caracas, which is also the largest city. The urbanization of the country since the 1950s has forced many people into urban slum settlements or barrios. Barrios are residential urban settlements progressively built by squatters on land that is not their own with no official planning permission and, more specifically, no urban design project that would meet the standards and regulations of any residential neighbourhood built in the same city during the same period. These unplanned settlements, consisting of buildings that are mainly for residential use and with insufficient infrastructure and services, are where most of the construction for residential use in the country occurs. It is estimated that more than 50 per cent of the population of the country lives in such urban slum settlements. In Caracas, a city with a population of close to 3 million, there are more than 1,000 barrios consisting of little more than shacks, often with no running water. Researchers at the Central University of Venezuela aimed to develop a plan to upgrade the barrios and improve the urban conditions of these settlements. This would require cooperation between the communities and the Government, the help of the private sector, professionals, researchers and technicians, and international advice. The programme sought to improve existing systems and develop the barrios to meet the standards of the city by addressing challenging environmental, cultural and community issues, enhancing people’s self-esteem by having them be the labour force and developing community capacity for self-management and self-reliance.",

Despite the fact that the city is the economic and financial heart of the country, the area displays chronic symptoms of a society struggling to grow economically and reduce social inequalities (see table). Disordered and unplanned expansion, lack of permanent and consistent public policies, dramatically unequal wealth distribution and an education system that struggles to find ways to recover from standards that declined over many years have created a complex environmental agenda covering air, visual and noise pollution; chaotic vehicular traffic; irregular land occupation; the constant threat of collapse of solid waste management; cases of recurrent soil and groundwater contamination; and an inadequate and unevenly distributed water supply network, among others.

Having achieved high scientific standards, broadly recognized in the country and abroad, the University is frequently requested to provide technical opinions, plans and solutions to many of the problems that afflict Brazilian society. Furthermore, owing to its excellence in research (an activity almost entirely financed by public funds), it creates around itself a strong expectation of change. This sentiment spreads to all of society but clearly is felt more intensely in the vicinity of the university, the local communities around the campus and the city of São Paulo. In this context, the University of São Paulo (USP) aimed to develop a programme that would aid surrounding local communities and tackle the city’s environmental issues. It is in the peripheral and degraded East Zone of São Paulo, with a population of 4 million, that the University made an ambitious attempt at establishing strategies to develop closer ties with local communities with the construction of a new campus and its youngest research unit, the School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities, inaugurated in 2005 (fig. 1). This project was described by its General Coordinator, Prof. Celso de Barros Gomes, as a “very rich opportunity of integrating USP in the local community towards the pursuit of a common objective: the creation of a pole of novel and dynamic knowledge aiming at benefiting both the University and the population”.",

    "abstract": "The rapid urbanization and industrialization since 1978 have posed some serious environmental challenges for sustainable development in China, with pollution and water shortages ranking among the most pressing issues. Although China is rich in water resources, water availability was only 2,343 cubic metres per capita per annum, which is just a quarter of the global mean. Water resources are unevenly distributed across the country. Floods take place very frequently (Lee, 2006). Before 2000, there was an administrative monopoly on water allocation, with many cities facing severe water shortages. However, with the increasing water shortages, the allocation of water rights solely through administrative means failed to meet the needs of rapid urbanization and economic development in some regions of the country. Yiwu City and Dongyang City became the first Chinese cities to experiment with the partial transfer of water rights in the country in 2000. The partial water-rights transfer agreement between the two cities initiated the reform of the water-resources management system in China.",

Development policies in Bangladesh recognized the pressing need to reduce the population growth rate in order to ease the mounting pressure on the country’s finite resources. This sense of urgency was amply expressed in the First Five Year Plan statement that “No civilised measure would be too drastic to keep the population of Bangladesh on the smaller side of 15 crores for the sheer ecological viability of the nation” (Government of Bangladesh, 1973). Realizing the urgency of the need to contain the rapid population growth, the Government of Bangladesh introduced domiciliary services in 1976 as an innovative approach to provide maternal and child health and family planning services. Family Welfare Assistants were recruited for delivering the domiciliary services nationwide. One Family Welfare Assistant was to serve 500 to 600 eligible couples. All Family Welfare Assistants were women and local residents. By introducing domiciliary services, the Government wanted to generate demand for family planning through counselling, cater to the people’s need for contraception, ensure easy access to services, and bring about changes in reproductive-health behaviour among Bangladesh Domiciliary Services in Reproductive Health and Family Planning 1 Mr. Mohammad Abdul Qayyum",

    "abstract": "Since the 1990s, many national population and family planning programmes have been under re-examination and reorientation in light of the Programme of Action adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994. This is the case in China. The present case study documents an experiment initiated by the State Family Planning Commission – now the National Population and Family Planning Commission – in 1995 to introduce the quality-of-care approach into China’s family planning programme in a few counties and districts. The introduction of this approach, which focuses on the standardized services and the client’s choices, was to serve as a means of reorienting the programme away from its previous demographically driven track as well as scaling it up nationwide thereafter. Following the official call of the State Family Planning Commission to reorient the family planning programme in both its guiding ideology and implementation approaches, the experiment was intended to demonstrate, through the pilot projects, how the programme could be reoriented and what a client-centred and quality-focused programme might look like in the context of China. With the field evidence, the experiment also sought to convince the people in charge of the programme at all levels that the full-fledged promotion of the reorientation of the programme nationwide would be feasible. 47 China Focusing on Quality of Care in the Family Planning Programme 2 Prof. Zhenming Xie The quality-of-care approach, well known as quality of care in family planning, focuses on the standardized services and the client’s choices. It was initiated in small areas and expanded to the whole country as the means of reorienting the family planning programme in China. The emergence of the pilot experiment in improving quality of care was by no means an isolated event; rather, it resulted from the interplay of a number of factors emerging in the early 1990s within and outside of China. The nationwide family planning programme was initiated in the early 1970s when the population of the country was",

    "abstract": "Since 1990, the Government of Ghana has put in place several mechanisms to reduce poverty and improve the standard of living of Ghanaians. These include the New Local Government System on Decentralization consolidated by the Local Government Act (Act 462) of 1993, the National Development Planning Commission Act (Act 479) of 1994 and the National Planning Systems Act (Act 480) of 1994. The goal of this legislation was to promote local development and encourage grass-roots participation in development. In 1996, when the National Development Planning Commission introduced the preparation of district development plans as part of the decentralization process, the aim was to promote a comprehensive and responsive approach to solving the problem of poverty by allowing District Assemblies to prepare their own plans to meet the needs and aspirations of their people. By 2000, it was clear that most of the district development plans prepared had not been implemented. This failure was held to be due to the theoretical nature of the plans, which did not reflect what departments could implement and what central government, the private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were able and prepared to fund. This lack of linkage between the plans and the ability to carry them out was related to the limited capacities of District Assemblies, which are responsible at the grassroots level for designing comprehensive plans aimed at poverty reduction. Thus in the preparation of the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy 1 and 2 policy documents, human resource development and good governance were seen as key to poverty reduction. 73 Ghana Training in Incorporating Population Factors into Development Planning 3 Dr. Yaw Nsiah-Peprah",

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, under the Reproductive and Child Health-II project, has included the adolescent reproductive and sexual health strategy to take care of the emerging needs and demands of adolescents. The present case study highlights the successful interventions carried out by the Society for Women and Children’s Health, a national NGO, in partnership with the State government in Yamuna Nagar District of Haryana, India. Prominent deficiencies existed such as a lack of provisions for privacy and confidentiality in the health centres and hospitals, no special clinic or fixed hours for adolescents, and inadequate information about the adolescents in the available records. The modules developed by the Government of India were used for the training of staff, and the health personnel in the district were trained through three-to-five-day training courses. Peer-group educators were selected according to the criteria developed and were trained in how to address queries by using the “‘frequently-asked-questions” approach.

The organization of these festivals was part of the implementation strategy to help to create awareness of adolescents’ issues. It was observed that over a period of nine months, a total of 2,851 adolescents (927 males and 1,924 females) visited the general outpatient departments and 283 cases were recorded as referral cases. Evaluation consisted of household surveys and quality assessments of health facilities based on standards set by the Government. A household coverage survey on 1,200 adolescents in 60 village clusters (30 control and 30 intervention clusters) was carried out, which demonstrated impressive improvements in the intervention villages. Remarkable improvements were demonstrated in the knowledge and use of adolescent-friendly health services and the utilization of public health services and better coverage in the iron deficiency anaemia prevention package, the purchase of sanitary napkins for menstrual hygiene, better access to contraception, knowledge of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and the use of condoms. Quality assessment was carried out in 12 health facilities (10 sub-centres and 2 primary health centres) each in the control villages and intervention villages where the adolescentfriendly health centres were established. The scores for different standards varied between 44 and 94 per cent in adolescent-friendly health and counselling service facilities in comparison to 1 to 59 per cent in the control facilities.",

First, during the New Order era (a term coined by former President Suharto to distinguish his regime from that of his predecessor when he came to power in 1966) and with strong support from the Government, the number of participants in the Programme increased significantly. The declining fertility rate has slowed population growth, which is turn has had a positive impact on the poverty alleviation programmes. Involvement of community leaders, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations was key to the success of the Programme. Indonesia is the biggest Muslim country in the world. Working closely with Muslim organizations and key leaders to get their support, the Family Planning Programme was able to forestall any objections on the part of religious leaders or opposition parties. The second phase unfolded following the Southeast Asian economic crisis, governmental change and decentralization at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s. In difficult economic circumstances and in a decentralized context, the Government was forced to scale back its commitment to family planning, which made it more difficult for people to obtain family Indonesia Importance of Community Participation in the Implementation of the Family Planning Programme 5 Mr. X.

    "abstract": "The initiative described in the present case study was undertaken in order to reintroduce the intrauterine device (IUD) into the contraceptive method mix and to increase its uptake in Kenya. The use of IUDS was declining despite the safety, effectiveness, convenience and low cost of the device. At the same time, the use of expensive, modern family planning methods such as injectables was on the increase. The percentage of women in Kenya who used IUDs for contraception dropped from 21 per cent in 1989 to 15.4 per cent in 1993 and to 7.6 per cent in 2003. The underuse of IUDs and other long-acting and permanent methods became a cause of concern to the Government of Kenya and those who make health policy. Overreliance on relatively expensive methods burdened the National Family Planning Programme, which was already faced with budget cuts as resources were increasingly directed to HIV/AIDS programmes, and limited women’s access to a full range of contraceptive options. At the same time, Kenya was undergoing serious challenges in ensuring familyplanning commodity security, with recurrent stock-outs. HIV/AIDS was attracting all the focus of all the players, including the bilateral partners.

    "abstract": "Santa Isabel is a poor community on the Caribbean coast of Panama. At the start of the project, the water supply infrastructure had fallen into disrepair and people in the local communities were unwittingly drinking contaminated water. A movement started within the local communities, involving local representatives of the region’s eight townships together with the Municipal Council and the Mayor of the District, to search for a sustainable and feasible solution to optimize safe drinking water for their residents. Cooperation with CATHALAC, the implementing institution, Fundación Natura and others convinced the Municipal Council of the importance of carrying out the entire project with the participation and support of the local community. Effective, continuous participation was achieved through intensive efforts of data collection and dissemination. Women, who are mainly responsible for water supply and use in Santa Isabel, were especially targeted. The project began by collecting data through interviews with local people in order to identify Santa Isabel’s water supply conditions, socioeconomic conditions, the environmental situation of each township, the usual practices of water usage and the economic and material resources that the Municipal Council could provide for the project. The analysis offered the information necessary for verifying existing problems and for adjusting the project’s goals, resources and methodology. It also revealed a high degree of community commitment. Water analyses revealed that bacterial contamination, mainly from livestock being allowed access to water sources, was a high risk to human health. In addition, deforestation in the catchment areas, which allowed soil to run off into the streams, and the inadequate use of pesticides near water sources had caused water quality to deteriorate further. As a result, several water sources were delineated, cleaned and protected. Two others were relocated upstream in order to optimize water quality. Storage tanks and distribution lines were cleaned and repaired or replaced with the participation of the community, producing an immediate improvement in water quality. In order to provide continuity and strengthen the adopted measures, a management plan was prepared and established for the protection, conservation and use of water sources in the district and to make water governance in the District of Santa Isabel a joint responsibility of the local government and the community. Within the framework of the project, the communities were trained to deter ❖ Costs: Funding was provided by: Fundación Natura: US$62,750; Municipality of Santa Isabel: US$15,700; community contributions: US$3,000; CATHALAC US$10,000.Total: US$91,450. Community involvement: Panama 99 mine the economic potential of their existing natural resources, how to use them in a sustainable way and how to identify the tourism potential that they offered. To achieve this potential, the residents were empowered to organize, develop and manage small businesses. The results of these comprehensive activities not only strengthened the supply of safe water to the communities but also provided ways by which the local people could improve their own socioeconomic and environmental conditions. The District of Santa Isabel is located on the Caribbean coast of Panama in the province of Colon (fig. 1). Its population comprises a small number of indigenous Emberá people, people of Antillean origin and migrants from the country’s interior influenced by Spanish colonization. These people live in eight townships, each of which elects a representative who, together with other representatives, forms the Municipal Council that periodically meets with government authorities to discuss the problems and needs of the local population. To date, water has been provided to the people of Santa Isabel via a series of community aqueducts built by the Government and administered separately by the communities with varying degrees of success. Over time, this model has more or less collapsed owing to an increase in water demand, the lengthening of the dry season and the exhaustion of several water sources. An increase in contamination was also posing an immediate health risk to the population, who believed that the water was still potable. Indeed, there was no system in place for monitoring water quality nor regulations to preserve the quality of water sources that supplied the community Figure 1. Location of the study site, Santa Isabel, on the Caribbean coast of Panama. aqueducts. Water quality and supply problems were being caused by increased deforestation, land erosion, the expansion of farming borders, the excessive use of pesticides in the vicinity of water sources, the unregulated development of new human settlements near water sources and the inadequate management of solid waste and wastewater. The water management scheme practised in the District of Santa Isabel was “vertical”, that is, imposed from above, and did not take into account the opinions and requirements of the local users. Real sustainable development can be achieved if communities participate in the entire process of a project, which means providing training and organization and raising awareness. The participatory model proposed by the Water Centre for the Humid Tropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC) and Fundación Natura made it possible for the local government to establish an appropriate solution to the population’s needs through the implementation of a project that, in the short term, trained and organized the community to solve the ongoing water quality and supply problems. In the medium term, the project established regulations for protecting water resources and water use and created the basis for promoting a new water culture among the population and its local authorities.",

    "abstract": "For more than two decades, the Population and Community Development Association (PDA) has implemented water resource development projects in northeast Thailand by providing wells, tanks, jars, village pipe water systems, latrines and grey water treatment plants that enable villagers to construct, operate and maintain their water resource systems. By involving local communities in the management and operation of their water supply systems, the project has increased the quantity and quality of the water supply in hundreds of villages in northeast Thailand, or more than 100,000 households. The success of these projects has meant that not only does the health of the villagers improve, but the supply of adequate quantities of safe drinking water can also be used to spur economic growth. A central component of the projects is the user-pays principle and the creation of a revolving-fund mechanism.Members pay a certain fee per cubic metre of water used. Village Water Management Committees (VWMCs), including women representatives, receive training from PDA in the maintenance and opera tion of the system and are responsible for deciding the charges. Over three years, villagers repay the costs of the system into a revolving fund. This allows them to generate an income by, for example, growing cash crops or raising fish or shrimp. In a recent World Bank-supported study, this project served as a sustainable, demand-driven, socially responsible, public-private partnership model. It provides an example of a case study that can easily be replicated in other countries. PDA is the largest and most diversified non-governmental organization in Thailand. More than 800 people work at its headquarters in Bangkok and 16 regional centres. Established in 1974, its participatory community-based approach to family planning helped to reduce the population growth rate of Thailand from 3.2 per cent in 1970 to below 1 per cent today. PDA has since expanded its operations to include primary health care, AIDS prevention, education, gender equality and democracy, promotion of ❖ Costs: Typical construction costs for a village piped water system (VPWS) are US$8,000. An additional US$1,750 is provided for community training and US$2,750 for management and overhead costs for three years. During the past 20 years, PDA has installed VPWSs in hundreds of villages, but always with the agreement that the villagers pay back the initial investment and provide for the long-term operation and maintenance of the systems by charging a user fee. From health to wealth: Thailand 113 income-generating activities, small and medium enterprises and rural industries, forestry and environmental conservation as well as water resource development and sanitation. The water supply in Thailand falls mainly under the responsibility of the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA) and the Provincial Waterworks Authority (PWA). MWA supplies around 3.9 million cubic metres per day of water for ten million people in Bangkok and the adjacent provinces of Nonthaburi and Samutprakan. PWA provides about 1.8 million cubic metres per day of water for some six million people in the remaining provinces of the country via ten regional offices and a series of 223 water plants (16 in the eastern region of the country, 49 in the central region, 38 in the south, 51 in the north and 69 in the northeastern region). Under the supervision of the Public Works Department, five city municipalities, 13 town municipalities and approximately 500 sub-district municipalities supply water for some four million people. However, more than 40 million people still reside beyond the water supply areas of the MWA, PWA and the municipalities (table 1). The northeast of Thailand is the poorest region of the country and home to 21 million people. Consequently, water is scarce and Government-provided water distribution systems in the villages are often non-existent, inefficient and/or expensive. Even so, the provision of water to rural Thailand has historically been approached from the position that “water is a right, and should be made available by the State to all Thais”. To achieve this objective, successive governments have overseen expenditures over the past two decades in excess of US$1,000 million across many government departments and constructed tens of thousands of Table 1.

However, each department has approached the challenge from its own perspective. The Department of Public Health, for instance, has tracked the health and sanitation benefits from its infrastructural improvements and has been able to demonstrate health benefits. However, income-generation has rarely, if ever, been taken into account when developing new water supply systems. Typically, these water systems are known as village piped water systems (VPWSs). As a result, as many as 50 per cent of the VPWSs built have been allowed to fall into disrepair and an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 rural villages (12 to 17 million people, or 27 to 35 per cent of the population of Thailand) remain without a reliable supply of safe tap water. Part of the problem is that these systems have been designed to provide water that reaches the national potable water standards. However, preference in rural Thailand is to use rooftop-harvested water for drinking as it is a traditional practice and the water is perceived to taste better. As a result, although government departments go to the expense of providing suitably treated water, it is not necessary. The complex VPWSs, therefore, are not maintained by the villagers, which accounts for their high failure rates. In addition, the current Government is following a policy of decentralization, and ownership of much of the water infrastructure that has been created has either been transferred, or is intended for transfer, to the rural communities. However, unless there is a demand-driven approach to rural water supplies, communities rarely embrace the opportunity to manage their water infrastructure. In addition, the rehabilitation of old systems is financially demanding. While it is clear that previous expenditure on water provision to rural Thailand has been well intended, this brings into question the efficiency of past water-related expenditure and the value of continuing such expenditures under the current system. In contrast, PDA has promoted water resource and sanitation management techniques designed to meet the needs of domestic and agricultural users in poor rural areas.",

    "abstract": "Although some 90 per cent of the population of Trinidad has access to an improved public water supply, this is often intermittent and only 14 per cent have access to a continuous supply. In January 2003, the Centre for Gender and Development Studies (CGDS), University of the West Indies, began studying access to public water on the island of Trinidad, particularly in relation to gender. A team consisting of a biologist, a geologist and a social scientist undertook a study of the community of Plum Mitan in east-central Trinidad. Since the early 1950s, this community has managed a local spring that has provided villagers with a supply of potable water independently of the national public water supply operated by the Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA). The situation is unusual as the dam and distribution systems are managed by a female-dominated village water council, which is responsible for organizing volunteer labour and fund-raising activities. Extra funds are put into a village bank account. This approach has resulted in the successful long-term, cooperative management of the Plum Mitan water supply. Water in Plum Mitan is abundant during the wet season and is available round the clock. During the dry season, however, the village council puts a curfew on water flow. Although this produces some complaints and causes some people to hoard water, the leader of the village council characterizes the system as one of successful “self-policing and self-regulation with a little fussing in between”. Although the system has operated for more than 50 years, it is about to be decommissioned because the dam cannot provide enough water to support recent increases in the demand for water brought about by an increase in the number of households in the area and lifestyle changes. In addition, WASA has recently provided Plum Mitan with mains water. The two-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago is aiming towards the goal of “Water for All”, which the Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) is working to achieve. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Water Supply and Sanitation Assessment Report of 2000 registered 86 per cent of the population of Trinidad and Tobago as having access to an improved water supply. By definition, this includes public standpipes, household connections, boreholes, protected dug wells and springs, and rainwater collection. In contrast, an unimproved water supply includes unprotected wells and springs, vendor- provided water, bottled water and tanker truck provision of water. The figure of 86 per cent is comparable to that reported for India (88 per cent) but is low compared to those for other Caribbean countries. Furthermore, in spite of the promises of different Governments to improve the water supply, the figure of 86 per cent Women in charge: Trinidad and Tobago 125 represents a substantial decrease over figures recorded for 1970 (93 per cent) and 1994 (98 per cent). This decrease can be accounted for by an increase in urbanization and the rise of squatter settlements. Also, although precise figures are not available, it is likely that there are disparities in water supply between urban and rural areas. In Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, WHO has cited an access rate of 93 per cent for people living in towns and cities but just 62 per cent for the rural population. Although the majority of the population of Trinidad is connected to a pipeborne water supply managed by WASA, key officials have described the water supply as “haphazardly intermittent”.  In 2001, the former Minister of Public Utilities noted that only 14 per cent of the population received water 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 32 per cent received water five to seven days a week; 13 per cent, three to five days a week; 18 per cent, two to three days a week; 13 per cent, less than two days per week; 4 per cent have the infrastructure for a pipeborne supply but receive no water; and 6 per cent have no infrastructure. These data were corroborated by the Minister of Public Utilities in 2003. The first organized water supply established on Trinidad was the Maraval waterworks, commissioned in 1853. Today, WASA is responsible for the public water supply system, 36 per cent of which is used domestically, 18 per cent by industry and 3 per cent by agriculture. However, this leaves as much as 43 per cent of the supply unaccounted for. In other words, it either never reached the customer or it was not paid for. This would include water lost from broken pipelines, water used for firefighting, water used in waste-treatment plants, reservoir seepage and overflow, evaporation, illegal connections and accounting errors. The amount of water that remains unaccounted for is about 8 per cent higher than the mean amount of water unaccounted for in large cities in Latin America and the Caribbean, suggesting problems with the infrastructure and management inefficiency by WASA. A Commission of Enquiry into all Aspects of the Operation of the Water and Sewerage Authority was held in 1973. However, the complaints received then continue in 2004, more than twenty years later.  These include: having to rely on water for cooking from springs a mile away; receiving a supply of pipe-borne water only at night; and, in some instances, dry taps for periods of two to three weeks and, in other instances, for up to three months, with truck-borne water being supplied only on an irregular basis after repeated requests. Several explanations have been put forward to account for the inadequate supply of water. In recent years, there has been a marked demand for water in industries since the national development is linked to the exploitation of petroleum and natural gas reserves and the development of industries such as iron and steel, methanol and nitrogen-based fertilizers. The old infrastructure is incapable of meeting these rising demands. In addition, there have been several reports of leaking pipes that are not repaired in a timely manner, leading to excessive wastage. Potable water is also used for agricultural purposes. An adequate water supply can be achieved only if water sources are used within the limits of renewability and are allowed to recharge themselves. While 50 per cent of the land area on Trinidad is forested, recharging of the water supply is compromised owing to excessive deforestation caused by rapid urbanization, quarrying, indiscriminate fires, logging, slash-and-burn hillside farming and clearing, and illegal squatting. These deforested mountain slopes are unable to retain water and have led to more frequent flooding in the wet season. The wet season, which runs from June to December, is one of the two distinct hydrologic seasons in Trinidad. A five-month dry season extends from January to May. The estimated mean annual rainfall is 2,200 millimetres, but 80 per cent of this occurs during the wet season. Prevailing winds are from the northeast and the Northern Range acts as a physical barrier to rainfall so that the highest mean annual rainfall, 3,800 millimetres, occurs in the northeast, which is sparsely populated. In contrast, the lowest mean annual rainfall occurs in the west, the area with the highest population density. Countries are said to be facing a serious water crisis when available water is less than 1,000 cubic metres per person per year. The renewable fresh water resources of Trinidad and Tobago are estimated to be 3,800 million cubic metres per year so that the per capita annual water availability is approximately 2,500 cubic metres. Therefore, the island is not water scarce. However, the temporal and spatial variations in rainfall in Trinidad, combined with the pattern of population distribution, the poor infrastructure and inadequate strategic planning at the local level, result in formidable challenges to those who aspire to a reliable, clean supply of potable water 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It was precisely to meet this challenge that the villagers of Plum Mitan rallied together in the early 1950s to harness the water from a nearby spring.",

    "abstract": "The River Zeravshan, which runs through Uzbekistan’s Bukhara province, has become highly mineralized and degraded because of the extraction of water for irrigating crops and the subsequent return of run-off water. Water in many of the area’s shallow wells also has a high mineral content. Bacterial contamination of the river and wells was also a problem. Owing to endemic poverty, many people living along the lower reaches of the river are forced to drink its water or pay high prices for alternative sources of safe water. Using hydrogeological studies, project scientists identified a previously almost untapped aquifer lying 60 metres to 150 metres below ground level. The installation of a pump into this aquifer is now providing safe drinking water for some 1,200 people. Medical examinations revealed that, within four months of operation, the health of the local population had improved dramatically. Other, shallower wells drilled on farms and in schoolyards are also providing safe drinking water. Owing to problems with drought in some years, there was also a need to address the water needs of local agricultural enterprises, which include the irrigated production of cotton and wheat. An agrometeorological site has been established where such parameters as soil and air temperature, soil and air humidity and rainfall are measured. Combined with an accurate map of the area, produced using a geographic information system (GIS), an irrigation water distribution model has been developed for use in drought conditions. The project was concerned with more than just water issues. Among the other positive outcomes is a higher level of awareness of broad environmental issues among the local people. Also, more women are now earning a living from activities not directly related to agriculture as a result of two workshops at which they were supplied with equipment and trained to produce sewn goods for sale. Uzbekistan is a newly independent country in Central Asia covering an area of 447,400 square kilometres and with a population of 26 million. Bordered by ❖ Costs: Through Germany’s obligations to the international Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD), the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for Technical Cooperation, or GTZ) GmbH provided US$100,000, with NIGMI providing US$10,000 in in-kind payments, including the provision of hydrometeorological data, hydrogeological maps, local travel and scientific advice. Tapping an aquifer: Uzbekistan 137 Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, its major geographical feature is the Aral Sea, located in the north of the country and shared with Kazakhstan. Bukhara province is situated in the Kyzylkum Desert along the lower course of the River Zeravshan (fig. 1) towards the south of the country. The local population relies on agriculture to provide an income and, in particular, the large-scale centralized production of irrigated cash crops such as cotton and wheat. Closer to the villages, subsistence horticulture is practised, with people growing potatoes, vegetables and various fruits. Poverty is common among these rural communities, especially among the unemployed and unskilled labourers, women whose husbands have either died or left the family and families lacking outside financial support such as money sent from relatives living in cities or abroad. These people require outside help to improve both their socio-eco nomic position and their heath. Malnutrition, for example, is a recurring problem due to crop failure during years of drought and access to safe drinking water is limited. The abstraction of water from the River Zeravshan for irrigating crops further upstream and the discharge of irrigation water back into the river mean that, often, little water reaches the local communities of Bukhara. Furthermore, the water that does reach the area has a high mineral content, with more than 2 grammes per litre of dissolved salts, and thus cannot be used as drinking water. Likewise, groundwater pumped from many farmyard wells contains up to 4 grammes of salt per litre, a concentration that can cause long-term health effects such as kidney failure if consumed on a regular basis. Both these sources of water are also contaminated with bacteria. In addition, using such water sources for the large-scale production of irrigated crops is causing the salinization of the topsoil, a problem that impacts on crop yields and is causing socio-ecological problems in the region. In addition, in drought years, there is sometimes insufficient water for irrigating the cotton and wheat crops, resulting in harvest losses. Such an irrigated area surrounded by desert also gives rise to the threat of desertification and irreversible land degradation during periods of drought. Fresh water of a more ancient origin (so-called “fossil” fresh water) is available in an aquifer about 100 metres below ground level and offers a safe alternative Figure 1. The lower reaches of the River Zeravshan,Bukhara province,Uzbekistan.By the time the water reaches this part of the river, it contains high concentrations of minerals. for both domestic use and irrigation. However, accessing and distributing this water are expensive. Paying for this fossil water can cost families up to one quarter of their monthly income, thus effectively forcing the poorest families to drink unsafe, salt-laden untreated water. Within the framework of the Subregional Action Programme to Combat Desertification in the Aral Sea Basin, the programme “Support of selected pilot projects for poverty alleviation and combating desertification in Central Asia” has received support from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) under the German Convention to Combat Desertification Project run by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Agency for Technical Cooperation, or GTZ). In Uzbekistan, as part of this major project, the project, “Stabilizing the land use system of the disadvantaged rural population in the Bukhara District by supporting the creation of an early warning system against drought”, has been chosen for implementation. The main project activities were based on surveys of the local population and ecological investigations. The main issues to be addressed included the continuing shortage of drinking water and water for irrigation and related environmental problems such as the threat of drought and soil salinization as well as social problems such as the status of women in the society and the lack of employment opportunities.",

    "abstract": "George Compound is an unregulated settlement of 130,000 residents on the edge of Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. The settlement is built on a limestone gravel rock formation and, although the residents use pit latrines, they also extract drinking water from shallow wells, often situated just a few metres from the latrines. In the early 1990s, outbreaks of diarrhoea and cholera were common owing to the practice of drinking water from these unprotected shallow wells. The Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC), Department of Water Affairs, Government of Zambia, implemented a water supply and sanitation improvement project from 1994 to 2000. Project components included: construction of a groundwater piped water supply scheme; public health education; and a community empowerment programme. The major areas of impact of the project included: improvement of solid and human waste disposal and general hygiene conditions in the compound; reduction of the incidence of cholera from 70 cases per 10,000 people in 1994 to one case per 10,000 by 2000; and the empowerment of communities to look after stand posts, pay for their water consumption and use communal toilets. The proper identification of the community’s needs and implementation of appropriate solutions have led to the sustainability of this community-based project. Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia, is built largely on flat ground underlain by a limestone complex consisting of marble, dolomite, schist and laterite (fig. 1). The outskirts of the city are surrounded by settlements that, over the years, have been upgraded by providing roads, electricity, piped water and other municipal amenities. One such settlement is George Compound, home to some 13,000 people. Owing to low pressure in the municipal water scheme serving about half of Figure 1. The underlying rock of George Compound is mainly limestone, a type of rock that readily admits the intrusion of water and can lead to problems of contaminated water reaching shallow wells from pit latrines. Upgrading a settlement’s water system: Zambia 147 George Compound, there was no reliable piped water supply. In addition, old asbestos-concrete pipes in the network were always leaking. The unreliability of the supply forced residents to sink shallow, unprotected wells on their premises to provide their daily water requirements. However, owing to space limitations, shallow wells were sited just a few metres from pit latrines sunk in the limestone gravel formation. This situation resulted in the persistent faecal contamination of the water wells. During the annual wet season (November to May), waterlogging was common and helped to create further unsanitary conditions that created ideal conditions for the spread of water-borne diseases. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the people of George Compound were victims of diarrhoea, cholera and malaria because of their poor water supply and sanitation situation. According to a survey conducted in 1994 by the Primary Health Care Unit of the Ministry of Health, 74 per cent of diarrhoea cases, 74 per cent of cholera cases, 63 per cent of eye infections and 56 per cent of skin disease cases recorded by the local health centre were from the sector of the population that obtained its domestic water from unprotected wells. The health centre also recorded 70 cases of cholera per 10,000 people in 1994.",

    "abstract": "Solar disinfection, or SODIS, is a simple method of producing safe drinking water at the household level. It involves exposing water in clear plastic bottles to the sun for several hours and relies on the action of solar radiation, particularly ultraviolet light, to inactivate pathogens. The method is easy to use and the costs are negligible as the basic resources required are sunlight, which is free, and plastic bottles that can be re-used several times. Although SODIS does not kill all the pathogens, health impact studies carried out to test the efficacy of the technique have shown that it can help to reduce significantly the incidence of diarrhoea. The SODIS Foundation was created in Bolivia in 2001 to promote the use of SODIS in Latin America. During 2001, an intensive campaign, including seminars for government institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the areas of education, health and sanitation, was undertaken in six countries, with a primary focus on Bolivia. ❖ Costs: For the first phase of the project (2001-2002), the SODIS Foundation received a total of US$482,000 from different donors, including the AVINA Foundation, Switzerland; the Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG) Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (SANDEC); and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. For the second phase (2003-2005), funds received from the AVINA Foundation, the government agency for international development of Liechtenstein, IBM Switzerland, the Lions Club and the Michel Comte Water Foundation (the last two also based in Switzerland) totalled US$1 million. In 2003 alone, the SODIS Foundation invested US$298,000 in projects in seven Latin American countries. This investment has been boosted by co-financing from partner institutions in Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru totalling more than US$400,000. Costs incurred by implementing agencies for the diffusion of solar disinfection (SODIS) are about US$10 per family, or US$1-2 per user. To date, these costs have been covered by the SODIS Foundation while other costs have been covered by the local partner. At the user level, the technology is free apart from the cost of the bottles. Solar disinfection: Latin America 159 In 2002, the SODIS Foundation created an international network of partner institutions responsible for the implementation of SODIS projects, with the common objective of gaining experience in how best to disseminate a cost-free method for treating drinking water. In 2003, government agencies and NGOs from seven focus countries received support from the SODIS Foundation in the form of funds, technical assistance and training materials. Experiences were exchanged in national and international workshops to further develop and improve the SODIS dissemination methodology. During the early phase of dissemination, the SODIS Foundation and its partners focused on the technical aspects of the method and SODIS was the only option offered to participating families. From late 2003 onwards, the implementation approach shifted to demand-driven and community-participation methodologies. In this way, SODIS is presented as an option along with other household disinfection methods such as boiling and chlorination and with additional hygiene messages. To date, the SODIS Foundation has co-financed more than 60 projects in the seven focus countries. By the end of 2003, it was estimated that some 100,000 people were using SODIS in Latin America and, in 2004, an additional 70,000 people started using it regularly. In Latin America, more than 77 million people lack access to safe drinking water. Recently, boiling and chlorination water treatment methods have been promoted at the household level by several agencies. However, these methods have disadvantages that limit their widespread diffusion. Chlorination, for example, changes the taste of the water and boiling relies on the use of scarce fuels. Furthermore, agencies typically promote only one of the options available, thus deciding which is the most appropriate for the families concerned. In view of this situation, it was clear that two new strategies to improve water quality at the household level were required: an improved water disinfection technology and a new dissemination methodology to change people’s habits. The solar disinfection (SODIS) method has been proven effective by several accredited research institutions (see www.sodis.ch) and provides a simple, cost-effective technology. With the development of a new dissemination methodology that relies on a demanddriven approach, the SODIS Foundation now also has the tool to increase the uptake of the technology among local communities in a sustainable manner.",

    "abstract": "Solar water disinfection, or SODIS, is a simple water treatment method that can be used at the household level to improve the microbiological quality of drinking water. Community Action Programme (CAP) is a non-governmental, non-profit organization working with a mandate to provide services, especially in poor areas of Pakistan, on issues relating to health, the environment and education. To date, CAP has completed two phases of a SODIS dissemination project. The main objective of Phase I (May 2002-April 2003) was to introduce SODIS to 9,000 families living in urban and peri-urban communities of Faisalabad. The project reached more than 9,000 families and achieved an acceptance rate of 30 per cent (2,700 families). Phase II (June 2003-May 2004) was designed to scale up the promotion and dissemination of SODIS through five local partner organizations in other cities in Pakistan, including Chiniot, Gojra, Jhang, Lahore and Rajoa. During Phase II, the aim was to use the five participating organizations to introduce SODIS to 25,000 families. Indeed, this target was surpassed, as SODIS was disseminated to some 26,000 families with an adoption rate of 47 per cent (12,000 families). Rigorous efforts have also been made to develop collaborations with various government agencies, including the National Programme for Family Planning and Primary Health Care (NPFP&PHC) of the Ministry of Health. To help to bring about further change at the grass-roots level, more than 100 women health workers have been trained in the dissemination and adoption of SODIS. With the assistance of an additional 70,000 women health workers of the NPFP&PHC, CAP has a great potential to scale up the promotion of SODIS in Pakistan. Pakistan is one of many developing countries in which the drinking of unsafe water causes health problems such as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea. Each year, millions of people are infected by waterborne diseases. Scientists estimate that some 80 per cent of stomach disorders are caused by drinking contaminated water. However, the agencies responsible for the provision of water in cities, towns and villages often lack the financial resources and up-to-date facilities required for tackling water-quality problems. In addition, although many government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have conducted research on water quality, few practical benefits have resulted from these projects. Community Action Programme (CAP) is based in Faisalabad, a city of more than 2 million people. Several years ago, in response to problems caused by the city’s heavy industrial pollution and poor water infrastructure, many govern Promoting SODIS: Pakistan 173 ment agencies, NGOs and communitybased organizations (CBOs) instigated campaigns to improve the health of the citizens of Faisalabad, especially in the “low profile” areas of the city. At that time, CAP began to implement a pilot project, “Diffusion of simple innovative technology among people of Pakistan for having pathogen-free drinking water”, with the financial assistance of the SOLAQUA foundation and other donors. One of the pollution problems of Faisalabad was that bacteriologically contaminated water from drains was being allowed to mix in canals and rivers, making such water sources unsafe for either drinking or irrigation purposes. At the same time, the level of the groundwater beneath the city was falling, so much so that, almost on a day-to-day basis, pumping the groundwater to the surface was becoming increasingly difficult. Under such circumstances, there was a need to create awareness among the people concerning the adverse health effects caused by drinking contaminated water and to educate them in the benefits of using safe, pathogen-free drinking water. For the past six years, some government and private agencies have been providing safe water to the people of Faisalabad on a commercial basis, charging from 20 to 30 rupees (up to US$0.50) for 1.5 litres. However, the city’s poorest people cannot afford such prices. In such circumstances, people choose to drink untreated water. The use of a simple, low-cost, effective technique for making contaminated water safe to drink, such as SODIS, is urgently required in such areas. There is also a need for governmental institutions, NGOs, donors and local community groups to join together to develop a strategy for the provision of pathogen-free drinking water for all.",

    "abstract": "The Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) is a non-governmental research organization that has been working in the water quality sector since its establishment in 1990. After conducting intensive research on different drinking water sources, ENPHO realized that people needed simple options to treat drinking water on a household scale since all types of drinking water sources in Nepal were likely to be heavily contaminated by microorganisms. The organization’s first attempt at providing an option for purifying water on a household scale was initiated in 1994 with the packaging of a 0.5 per cent chlorine solution in locally made 60-millilitre dropper bottles under the brand name Piyush. In 2002, ENPHO carried out comprehensive research on a technique known as solar water disinfection (SODIS) being promoted by the Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (SANDEC) of the Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG) in collaboration with EAWAG/SANDEC, the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). After demonstrating that the use of SODIS was effective at removing pathogens from water, ENPHO began promoting the technique as an option for producing safe drinking water in 2002. Another problem with Nepal’s water resources is the presence of arsenic, which has recently been discovered in a shallow aquifer in the Terai region. ENPHO, in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), therefore started introducing the KanchanTM Arsenic Filter (KAF) as a household treatment option in arsenicaffected regions in 2003. Unlike Piyush and SODIS, the filter addresses both microbiological and arsenic problems. Today, ENPHO is promoting all three techniques as point-of-use options for treating drinking water in Nepal. Experiences have revealed that each option has some limitations, including cost, accessibility and social acceptance, and users must decide which option to choose. Typically, Piyush is now being used by middle-class urban dwellers, trekkers, the army and police force and in disaster areas where flooding and the potential for water-borne epidemics call for water treatment. SODIS is being used in many poor urban communities as ❖ Costs: For Piyush marketing, there was an annual budget of about US$7,000. The SODIS research and promotion budget was US$25,000, while the KanchanTM Arsenic Filter promotion programme was supported by a US$115,000 grant from the World Bank. Household-scale water treatment: Nepal 181 well as by the middle classes, and local entrepreneurs are now promoting the KanchanTM Arsenic Filter in arsenicaffected communities. Over the past two decades, Nepal has increased the number of its people with access to either piped municipal water supplies or tube well water sources to 81 per cent of the population. However, these high levels of coverage do not necessarily ensure the provision of safe water. Municipal water supplies are rarely chlorinated to adequate levels and bacterial contamination in tap water is common. Widespread bacterial contamination problems have also been identified in other kinds of water supply systems used in rural areas of the country. These water quality problems are frequently exacerbated by unsafe water storage practices in both urban and rural regions. Sewer systems and other infrastructure relating to the disposal of wastewater are also either non-existent or in poor condition. As a result of the failure to provide safe water and adequate sanitation, water-borne diseases are common. Regular outbreaks cause frequent hospitalization and infant mortality is high (91 deaths per 1,000 live births). In addition to microbiological contamination, arsenic-contaminated water is also having an impact on public health in the Terai region of the country. In total, more than 3 million people are at risk owing to arsenic in drinking water in Nepal. Although Nepal has increased access to piped water, investment in the installation of treatment facilities has been patchy and poor sanitary and hygienic practices are a major cause of contamination in the water supplied to the population. In addition, there are still many communities in the country where there is no access to water supply systems. As a result, people are dependent on traditional sources such as wells, stone spouts, open springs, rivers and ponds. These sources often contain a high level of bacterial contamination. Despite such problems, few people give a high priority to the quality of the water that they drink and awareness of techniques to improve household water quality is limited. People simply cover their water vessels to protect the water from contamination. Prior to the project, only 12 per cent of households treated their drinking water by other means, the most common of which are boiling, filtration and, sometimes, the use of chemical disinfectants. All of these technologies, however, have some limitations, so many people do not use them. Against this background, raising awareness of the issues and promoting point-of-use options for drinking water treatment can play a vital role in ensuring access to safe, clean water. ENPHO, both with its own programmes and in collaboration with different partners, has successfully introduced three point-of-use drinking water treatment options: • Piyush, a chlorine solution; • solar water disinfection (SODIS); and • the KanchanTM Arsenic Filter.",

    "abstract": "A policy adopted by the Government of Barbados and implemented by the Barbados Water Authority since 1963 provides protection to the nation’s groundwater by dividing the island into five zones. The policy was revised in 1972 to allow for developments that predated the implementation of the policy to upgrade their facilities under specific conditions. Additional limitations to activities permissible in Zones 1 and 2 were added in 1994. Under the system, four of the five zones (Zones 1 to 4) are designed to protect the groundwater quality of the public water supply wells, while Zone 5 falls outside and downstream of the water collection areas for these wells. Land in Zone 1 surrounds existing and future public water supply locations and has the most stringent restrictions. By placing restrictions on the land uses in the various zones as well as controlling the location of various industrial and commercial activities (for example, Class 1 agriculture, the raising of animals and poultry, is prohibited in Zone 1), the enactment of the water protection policy has resulted in the protection of Barbados’ groundwater resources without resorting to the more expensive option of water treatment. The current groundwater production cost is estimated at just US$0.50 per cubic metre. It is also important to note that there have been no reported incidents of bacteriological contamination of the water since the policy was implemented. The island of Barbados covers 430 square kilometres and has a resident population of 260,000 people. It also welcomes more than 500,000 long-stay visitors each year. The water requirements of these people are supplied entirely from groundwater obtained from an unconfined coral rock aquifer formation. Owing to the unconfined nature of the aquifer system, it is vulnerable to surface land-use activities, including housing developments and their waste-disposal systems. Prior to the implementation of the water protection policy in 1963, there was no sewage system in Barbados. Sewage was generally disposed of by sinking soak-away pits into the coral rock until a fissure was encountered that was wide enough to absorb the waste. When these pits were constructed too close to the water supply wells, there was great difficulty in preventing their contamina ❖ Costs: The Government of Barbados provided in-kind contributions to the United Nations technical assistance study by providing staff, equipment and other resources. It also covers the ongoing implementation of the study recommendations through the annual budget of the Barbados Water Authority. Groundwater protection zones: Barbados 197 tion with wastewater. Fortunately, the most densely populated areas have always been located downstream of the main public supply wells. However, in 1961, bacteriological contamination of the groundwater was recognized as the most serious threat to the Barbados water supply. At the time, although sugar cane was being grown on 60 per cent of the island’s unpopulated land, cultivation practices, including planting the cane in shallow holes dug by hand, did not involve the use of large amounts of chemicals. Sugar cane production, therefore, did not pose a threat to the island’s groundwater reserves. With the modernization of sugar cane production and diversification of the island’s agricultural practices, this is no longer the case. With available water resources allocation of 390 cubic metres per capita per year, Barbados is now classified as a “water-scarce” country and cannot afford to allow a single water supply well to become polluted whether by untreated domestic wastewater or by agrochemicals. The final report of the United Nations technical assistance project justified the implementation of a water protection policy with the following conclusions: • Although the islanders were using water for the disposal of household and industrial wastes, there was often a time lag between such activities and the realization of their consequences. One of the island’s most valuable assets is its natural reserve of good-quality groundwater. However, with the uncontrolled disposal of community wastes, the stage had been reached where the practice was becoming hazardous to the existing quality of Barbados’ drinking water. There were even fears that water quality could be irrevocably compromised. • Until more scientific work has been carried out on the disposal of sewage and waste, the best option would be to protect the water supply through a preliminary scheme taking into consideration the topographical and geological conditions of Barbados. • Calculations showed that the areas suitable for providing safe drinking water were capable of producing about 136,364 cubic metres per day based on an average annual rainfall of 1,016 millimetres. In 1961, private and domestic water use totalled just over 80,000 cubic metres per day, providing a reserve of about 55,000 cubic metres per day. If all houses in Barbados were to be provided with piped water and the present consumption of 190 litres per head per day were maintained, total demand would rise to 131,820 cubic metres per day, which would require almost the entire groundwater resources of Barbados. • The principles used in dividing the island into water protection zones were based on existing and proposed pumping stations. The boundaries of the different zones were selected so that no wastewater would reach a public well within 300 days, a sufficient period to ensure that any contaminating bacteria would die off. The time taken for wastewater to arrive at a given well depends on the percolation route down to the water table, the thickness of coral rock, and the more or less horizontal flow rate below the water table. • Large areas of the island, including much of Zone 5, are also suitable for the use of suck wells. However, it is believed that petroleum products take six years or more to break down. Therefore, only in areas where groundwater flow will not reach valuable reserves (classed as Zone 5) are installations of filling stations permitted without certain safeguards. Petrol tanks on sugar plantations were also a latent danger to the groundwater (except in Zone 5) and the disposal of used oil or other similar products into pits or wells in coral rock should under no circumstances be permitted. Based on these recommendations and the available hydrogeological data, the island was divided into five groundwater protection zones (fig. 1), with different restrictions on development and other practices enforced in each zone (table 1). However, in 1963, when these recommendations were made, there was only a limited amount of hydrogeological data available for the island. Indeed, how much confidence could the country place in a water protection system that was based on the time required for water to travel a certain distance when the assumed normal diffuse flow of groundwater could be short-circuited by water flowing through conduits in the coral rock? At the time, such questions as how much groundwater moved by diffuse flow and how much by conduit flow were open to debate. It was also noted that restrictions on the construction of new structures and the prohibition of the provision of new water services in Zone 1 would pose greater hardships on people who owned land or lived within that zone compared to those owning land or living in other zones. Since approximately nine per cent of the country’s land mass is classed as Zone 1 (fig. 2), the Government had to decide whether this was socially and politically acceptable and whether preventing building on so much land could have future economic costs.

    "abstract": "This case study describes the Jordan Water Quality Management Project (JWQMP), the overarching aim of which is to protect and improve the water quality of drinking water sources in Jordan, thereby helping to protect public health and safeguard investments in infrastructure. Key elements include the development of clear, appropriate and enforceable drinking water regulations; the strengthening of monitoring activities (planning, sampling, analysis and data management) by using the internationally recognized ISO 17025 standard as the basis and motivation for improving practices; the implementation of a source water protection programme to slow down any deterioration of groundwater quality; and the improvement of operations and maintenance practices at drinking water facilities. (This final part of the programme is not covered in detail in the present report, which will focus on more innovative aspects.) JWQMP is a USAID-funded project for which the implementing institution, CDM International, Inc., is providing technical assistance to the Water Authority of Jordan and the Ministry of Health. By 1997, the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) had realized that the water quality at several of its wells and springs had deteriorated to the point where simple disinfection was no longer adequate for protecting public health. A two-pronged approach to the problem would have been to first protect these sources to prevent further water quality deterioration, followed by further treatment to bring the water to appropriate standards. WAJ focused most of its efforts on the treatment facilities and commissioned CDM International, Inc., via USAID, to design and construct treatment facilities at six sites at a cost of over US$23 million. In 2001, after the investments had been made and the treatment plants completed, their smooth operation and delivery of safe water to the public were hampered by changes in regulatory guidelines that meant that some plants were shut down more than 30 per cent of the time. USAID sought to take stock of past achievements and obstacles and set a progressive, rational plan of action for future assistance. ❖ Costs: United States Agency for International Development (USAID): US$3 million for technical assistance and procurement (includes programme components not discussed below). Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ): an estimated US$1 million for related infrastructure and programme supervision. Protecting source water: Jordan 209 Jordan’s water supply problem is one that affects the whole eastern Mediterranean region. The unregulated activities of a growing population result in increasing groundwater pollution. These people also demand increasing quantities of high-quality drinking water. The problem is made more acute in Jordan, where water scarcity forces the abstraction of drinking water from potentially risky sources. In addition, deteriorating source water quality demands increasingly sophisticated treatment technology. However, the importation of such technology into an inadequate, uncoordinated and overly conservative regulatory framework can provide a false sense of security rather than safeguard public health. Further problems arise because the process to develop Jordanian Drinking Water Regulations continues to be under-resourced. No agency has the clear mandate, time or resources to study and legislate over the increasingly complex, multidisciplinary problems inherent in integrated water resources management. CDM International, Inc., therefore, undertook to review the entire drinking water supply system in Jordan. This review revealed weaknesses in several areas, including: • groundwater under the influence of surface water represented a large proportion of the drinking water supply; • the quality of source water was deteriorating, with increasing levels of microbiological and nitrate contamination; and • there was a general lack of data on many water-quality parameters. It was therefore decided that a source protection programme was needed and the Jordan Water Quality Management Programme (JWQMP) was launched. Monitoring of the total water cycle came under the jurisdiction of the WAJ Central Laboratory and the Environmental Health Directorate (EHD) Laboratory of the Ministry of Health (MOH). However, there was often no consensus between data generated by WAJ, EHD and the MOH Jerash Directorate water-quality laboratories, owing to the lack of a systematic approach to laboratory practices and quality control. These practices could be improved by implementing an ISO 17025 plan. The desire to work in, and have as an asset, an ISO-accredited laboratory gave both the laboratory staff and management a strong motivation to improve laboratory practices. Also, because ISO accreditation needs to be maintained on an annual basis by demonstrable indicators, ISO accreditation provides a long-term, sustainable mechanism for ensuring good laboratory practices.",

    "abstract": "The integrated study of the groundwater resources of the Sfax region of Tunisia is part of a larger programme for the development of regions of the Sahara and the south of Tunisia financed with the cooperation of the Government of Italy. The main objectives of the project were to identify the groundwater resources of the Sfax region, to define their quantitative and qualitative characteristics, to develop a rational scheme based on computerized tools for the use and management of these resources, and to provide training for the engineers and technicians of the General Directorate of Water Resources (DGRE). The methodology developed to reach these objectives was based on a multidisciplinary approach using a variety of exploration techniques. Further studies, field investigations and laboratory analyses were then implemented to complete the data-gathering component of the project. These data were then fed into a database and analysed to determine whether the groundwater systems identified were being overexploited or not and, given predictions for future trends in population growth and water requirements in the region, whether aquifer water could sustainably supply these needs. In Tunisia, particularly in the south of the country, groundwater is the main water resource and is used by agriculture (80 per cent), industry (10 per cent) and domestically (5 to 10 per cent). The Sfax region, located on the east coast of the country (fig. 1), has an underground water system composed of a deep confined aquifer and 15 water tables or surface aquifers that are delimited by their respective catchment areas. Recently, water management authorities have been facing problems associated with declining water quality and increasing demand for water through population and economic growth and the improved standards of living that accompany such changes. Indeed, although some 10 million cubic metres of water were pumped from a deep-lying aquifer each year from 1978 to 1986, between 1987 and 2003, this quantity increased to some 26 million cubic metres (fig. 2). The 15 surface aquifers are also believed to be overexploited, especially near the coast. In addition, the quality of Figure 1. Location map of the project study area. Mapping groundwater resources: Tunisia 221 the water that they contain has become degraded owing to their increased exploitation through the construction of new pumping wells, the intrusion of seawater and the infiltration of water that has been used to irrigate crops. Until recently, the lack of any the synthesis, interpretation and archiving of data concerning these aquifers led to the lack of an accurate description of them. This, in turn, led to the region’s water resources being undervalued and hence to difficulties in establishing a suitable management plan. Against this background, the regional water resources management authority was facing a major problem in gathering, synthesizing, interpreting and updating data on the aquifers. In particular, a safe, sustainable yield of both the surface and deep aquifers was not well defined. Since monitoring wells and piezometers (devices used to monitor water flow and measure water pressure in aquifers) are located mainly in the coastal area, the hydrodynamic characteristics of the aquifers are not well defined over their full ranges. Ensuring the sustainable management of the groundwater resources requires an understanding of the behaviour of water in the underground systems. Owing to the large size of the project area (fig. 1) and the quantity of data needed to characterize the aquifers properly, particularly those that are being highly exploited, the use of computerized tools is necessary. Hence, the first phase of the current project was to construct a hydrogeological database based on locations mapped precisely using a geographic information system (GIS). The combination of these techniques permitted the processing and interpretation of the data gathered during the remainder of the project, including data collected from deep and shallow borings, seismic tests, piezometer readings and geo-electrical profiles. The ultimate aim of the project is to define both the safe and sustainable groundwater yield for the aquifers of the Sfax region and the areas from which they are recharged. Protecting these recharge areas, for example through soil conservation techniques, and improving the rate of infiltration of water down to the aquifers will help to protect the aquifers themselves. To achieve these aims required the creation of a network for monitoring changes in the quality and quantity of groundwater, the identification of highly vulnerable areas, the establishment of procedures to protect aquifers from sources of pollution, and the establishment of a procedure for the effective management of groundwater data.

    "abstract": "Papallacta Lake provides drinking water for the 1.2 million inhabitants of Quito, the capital city of Ecuador, as well as local communities. Lake water is also used by cattle and for a recently developed trout-farming industry. The lake collects water from many sources, including volcanic and thermal springs. Recent geochemical studies have shown that most of the water from volcanic/thermal sources that feed Papallacta Lake carries dissolved arsenic. As a well-known toxin, many countries have introduced legislation that limits the concentration of arsenic in drinking water to a maximum of 50 microgrammes per litre (µg/l). (The World Health Organization, WHO, recommends a maximum limit of 10µg/l.) Some of the hot springs that feed Papallacta Lake have very high arsenic concentrations; in some cases, concentrations of more than 10,000 µg/l (or 10 mg/l) have been detected. At present, water from Papallacta Lake receives conventional physical and chemical treatments to ensure that it is safe for human consumption and it arrives in Quito without detectable levels of arsenic. However, communities living around Papallacta Lake are exposed to this toxic element, which may affect not only themselves but also their cattle and trout-farming activities that rely on the lake’s water as a major resource. This initiative proposes the treatment of water from hot springs with adsorption columns composed of a layer of iron oxides followed by a layer of activated carbon before the water is used locally for human consumption. The combined use of iron oxides and activated carbons that are specifically prepared to adsorb dissolved metals assures the removal of arsenic. In addition, activated carbons have the capability of removing other metals and organic contaminants that may be present in solution. Important objectives of this initiative are the design involves building adsorption columns to remove the arsenic from lake water used for local consumption, is in progress. A small column has been tested in the field but, because there are no changes that can be detected simply by looking at the water, the local people are reluctant to accept the filtered water. It is estimated that educating the local communities will take some six months. ❖ Costs: A grant from TWAS, the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World, covered the US$2,000 cost of the survey for sources of arsenic. Adsorption columns with a treatment capacity of 20 litres per minute will cost less than US$2,000 each, with an operating cost of US$100 per month. Removing arsenic: Ecuador 231 of a mobile system that may be used on site and the development of awareness in the local communities of the fact that, in order to avoid health problems, arseniccontaminated water must be treated before it is suitable for human and animal consumption. Papallacta Lake (fig. 1), located 80 kilometres southeast of Quito, provides 20 per cent of the capital city’s water supply. In addition, lake water is used by local communities for human consumption, cattle consumption and for a recently developed trout industry. On 8 March 2003, a pipeline used to transport some 400,000 barrels of petroleum per day collapsed, spilling about 8,000 barrels of petroleum a short distance from Papallacta Lake. Local vegetation and fauna were destroyed by the spillage and local communities, comprising some 1,000 people, were unable to use water from the polluted lake. In addition, their cattle were affected and their US$75,000 investment to develop a trout-farming industry was lost. Remediation of the spill site, undertaken by the Governmentowned oil company responsible, cost some US$2 million, took one year to complete and included biological, chemical and physical techniques. During the remediation process, chemical analyses showed significant amounts of arsenic in the lake water. As arsenic is not usually found in petroleum, the National Congress of Ecuador commissioned the Departamento de Metalurgia Extractiva (Department of Extractive Metallurgy) at the Escuela Politécnica Nacional (National Polytechnic University) to investigate possible sources of arsenic in the waters of Papallacta Lake. Arsenic is widely distributed in the environment and is found in many organic and inorganic compounds. In acidic waters, inorganic arsenic easily adsorbs to suspended material and sediments, especially clays, iron oxides and organic material. Chronic exposure to arsenic causes so-called black foot disease, characterized by skin and vascular injury. Arsenic also affects the nervous system and the liver and is considered a carcinogenic substance, being associated with cancers of the bladder, kidney, lung and skin, among others. In this context, it is important to determine the sources of arsenic in Papallacta Lake. As the lake, which is situated in a micro basin covering some five square kilometres, is fed by a significant number or sources of volcanic and Figure 1. Papallacta Lake and its surroundings. thermal origin, one hypothesis was that arsenic had a hydrothermal origin and did not result from the petroleum spillage. The second part of this case study involves the use of adsorption columns for removing arsenic from lake water used for local consumption. The use of iron oxides for adsorbing arsenic from aqueous solutions is well documented and currently found in regions where the groundwater is rich in arsenic. Activated carbon is also widely used to remove contaminants such as dyes, odours and heavy metals from aqueous solutions and gases. The combined use of iron oxides and activated carbons in a column will assure the removal of dissolved arsenic from the water from Papallacta Lake.",

    "abstract": "This case study describes an innovative system for supplying safe drinking water to a small rural community in Mexico. A system has been developed that combines a rainwater harvesting pond followed by treatment of the water in a modular plant that works without electricity. A pilot study of the technology demonstrated its technical, social and economic feasibility. In Mexico, depending on the climate and accessibility, the use of water to satisfy the primary needs of drinking and cooking has been estimated to be between 25 and 100 litres per person per day. However, throughout Mexico, there are at least 6,714 rural communities with less than 200 inhabitants that do not have ready access to safe drinking water. Almost 100 of these are in the State of Mexico, where 15 per cent of the 12 million inhabitants live in rural communities of 2,500 people or less. Despite the high population of this State and its importance to the Mexican economy, villages such as Ejido de Tres Barrancas, located in the municipality of Almoloya de Juárez, lack adequate access to water resources. During the rainy season (May to August), villagers of Ejido de Tres Barrancas took advantage of rainwater collected in buckets and basins to satisfy part of their water requirements, but during the dry season, they had to travel four kilometres to reach a source of clean water. Because of this situation, the use of water was limited to approximately 10 litres per capita per day. Human health depends not only on the amount of water available, but also on its quality. In 1990, diseases caused by poor water quality affected 20 out of every 100,000 inhabitants in Mexico. By 1995, there had been a 25-per cent decrease to 15.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. However, although mortality rates due to diarrhoea have declined steadily, they are still high when compared to those in developed countries. In many areas of Mexico, drinking water is obtained from springs or wells. Generally, it is of good quality and requires only chlorination to make it safe to drink. Countrywide, there is generally good access to drinking water services, with 84 per cent of the population being reached. Nevertheless, small communities of less than 200 inhabitants that are far from urban centres and difficult to reach are often “forgotten”. One such village was Ejido de Tres Barrancas.

    "abstract": "The majority of people living in rural areas of Zimbabwe obtain their drinking water from rivers. Although chemical and microbiological water quality monitoring programmes are well established in Zimbabwe, the quality of the nation’s rivers has been progressively deteriorating, partly because of various constraints on the monitoring programmes. Biological monitoring, which involves an assessment of the macroscopic life in the rivers, provides an alternative means of evaluating the quality of riverine environments and would complement chemical monitoring in an effective, countrywide water quality management system. The main objective of the project, therefore, was to undertake research to establish reference sites suitable for the long-term biomonitoring of water quality in Zimbabwean rivers. To achieve this, a methodology developed and applied in South Africa was adopted. This involved a desktop study aimed at establishing a spatial framework of the river systems in Zimbabwe. A pilot site, the Manyame catchment area in the north of the country, was subsequently chosen to assess whether the system developed in South Africa could be replicated in Zimbabwe. If so, the results of the pilot project would help to guide the implementation of a biomonitoring programme in Zimbabwe and ultimately throughout southern Africa. Zimbabwe has suffered recurring water shortages over the last decade as a result of below-average rainfall. As a consequence, there has been a realization that the management of water resources in this water-scarce country is essential if national development is not to be constrained by water availability and if maximum benefits are to be gained from existing water resources. Along with chemical and microbiological monitoring, biological monitoring (or, more simply, biomonitoring) is a valid way of determining the quality of a body of water. It is based on the fact that different species of aquatic insect prefer different types of water. Species that live in fast-flowing streams, for example, will most likely not be found in muddy pools and vice versa. Any changes in the insect fauna of a river, therefore, can help to identify changes in water quality, whether it is changes in oxygen content, pH, or other parameters caused by pollution from agricultural run-off or wastewater dumping. Biomonitoring, therefore, can have applications in integrated catchment management and can help to ensure the sustainable utilization and management of water resources. It can also provide information that can be used to assess the potential effects of proposed water resource development plans, including, for example, the pumping of water from one catchment area where water is plentiful to another where it is scarce. Biological monitoring: Zimbabwe 249 Information on the aquatic biodiversity in Zimbabwe was last assessed in the 1960s and biomonitoring as a tool to monitor water quality was used only as a research tool. The objective of this project was to use biomonitoring as a complementary tool to the existing practice of chemical water quality monitoring. However, although both chemical and microbiological water quality monitoring is well established in Zimbabwe, the quality of the nation’s rivers has been progressively deteriorating due to constraints on the monitoring programmes. Against this background, a pilot biomonitoring project was conceived with the primary aim of initiating a nationwide biomonitoring programme to complement chemical monitoring. In this biomonitoring programme, the South African Scoring System version 4 (SASS4) was used. SASS4 is a rapid biological assessment method that was developed to evaluate the impact of changes in water quality using aquatic macro-invertebrates such as insect larvae as indicator organisms. One advantage of biomonitoring is that it is simple to carry out and requires no sophisticated equipment. In addition, people in rural areas can easily be trained to use biomonitoring principles themselves to determine whether their water is safe to drink or not.",

    "abstract": "As a small developing country covering just 50,000 square kilometres — slightly larger than Denmark — Costa Rica has few natural resources. However, located in the tropics, it is renowned for its abundant biodiversity and, dating back to 1969, its pioneering efforts to conserve it. A joint programme between the Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad (INBio) and the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) through its Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) was developed to promote the sustainable use of this biodiversity for commercialization by local small enterprises. Under the programme, INBio and Laboratorios Lisan S.A., a Costa Rican pharmaceutical company, agreed on a collaborative research strategy aimed at developing pre-commercial-stage pharmaceuticals from selected medicinal plants. Six phytopharmaceutical products were successfully developed during the programme and these have now been registered for use in Costa Rica. Among the other major areas of impact of the project were: • validation that research and development programmes can be led by institutions in developing countries; • benefits to the company through the development of standardized phytopharmaceuticals as alternative medicines; • the generation of new training and employment opportunities through the introduction of non-traditional products that adhere to the highquality standards required by developed countries; and • the sustainable use of biodiversity. The majority of pharmaceutical products sold worldwide have been developed from natural products. Over the past several years, therefore, INBio has developed research expertise in plant extraction techniques and chemistry. Much of this experience was gained collaborating with international pharmaceutical companies. However, these efforts did not result in any tangible products that could be developed for the market in either the short or medium term. As such, INBio’s expertise was not being fully exploited. For these reasons, INBio began searching for partners among local pharmaceutical companies. Costa Rica’s biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector is composed mostly of companies that use pre-existing techniques, produce generic drugs or are subsidiaries of international firms. Needless to say, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that invest in research and development are few and far between, and national funding sources are scarce. Venture capital funds for Costa Rican SMEs, for example, are more frequently channelled towards the growing software industry. As with other local pharmaceutical companies, the business plan of Roadmap to commercialization: Costa Rica 19 Laboratorios Lisan S.A. was to produce and sell synthetic generic drugs. Prior to this programme, the company had ventured into natural product formulation but had encountered many difficulties. Instead, as a result of collaborating with INBio, Laboratorios Lisan has now successfully launched a range of natural products as part of its Lisanatura initiative. The resulting Lisanatura products are novel and provide the company with a comparative advantage over other local companies that produce only generic drugs or natural products lacking adequate quality control.",

    "abstract": "CDRI was established in 1951 with the mandate to provide a leading role in the development of India’s science and technology capability in drug research and development, to undertake frontline research, and to provide specialized science and technology services and human resource development. Early in its history, the Institute formulated programmes covering the whole range of activities in drug discovery and development, including • exploration of natural products; • synthetic chemistry for the development of new therapeutic agents; • basic and applied studies on such medical problems as age-related, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, fertility regulation and tropical diseases; and • all stages of preclinical regulatory studies and Phase I clinical trials. Over the past 20 years, and more particularly in the last decade, a new sce nario has emerged, spurred on by advances in molecular biology, interinstitutional collaboration, the emergence of a new international patent regime, increased global interest in herbal products, the liberalization of the Indian economy and an increase in investment in research and development by Indian pharmaceutical companies. Each of these factors has helped to influence and mould the Institute’s research and development policies. However, while the major focus is to derive novel lead molecules from medicinal plants and develop them as modern drugs, alternative approaches for developing plant products into commercially viable herbal preparations are also followed. Indeed, the CDRI drug development programme relies heavily on traditional knowledge of herbal remedies — a practice now vigorously followed by international pharmaceutical companies. Initially, at CDRI, only plants described in traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda and Unani were investigated. However, in the mid-1960s, the programme was widened to include other indigenous plants and to focus on the arteether (antimalarial), Consap (spermicidal cream) and Isaptent (cervical dilator).This case study will focus on the first three of these products. \ufffd Costs The total cost of pursuing and sustaining a multiplicity of projects in the natural product area over the last 50 years — based on 10 per cent of the total expenditure of the Institute — comes to approximately 290 million rupees, or US$6.5 million. Drug discovery and development: India 31 isolation and characterization of their biologically active constituents. In short, the main feature of the CDRI programme for developing new products from medicinal plants is its broad-based, multidisciplinary programme. Sustained efforts over 50 years have helped to develop the infrastructure, facilities and expertise required for the generation of new knowledge and the exploitation of identified lead compounds for commercialization. When India obtained its independence in 1947, traditional systems of medicine constituted the mainstay of health care service to the country’s large population. Indeed, even today, 70 per cent of the population uses traditional medicine for treating various ailments and diseases. In 1951, when CDRI was established, there was no expertise or capability in drug research in India. The basic objective of CDRI, therefore, was — and continues to be — the development of modern drugs. This is a time-consuming and expensive process and, in the early days, new drug discovery was dependent solely upon the chance finding of new lead molecules after screening a large number of potential sources. Therefore, it was decided that this search would be narrowed to plants with known therapeutic activities used in traditional remedies. In India, three major indigenous systems of medicine are practised, namely, Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. Among these, Ayurveda alone describes the use of over 600 plants in some 8,000 preparations — mostly crude drugs, based mainly on extracts, pastes or powders of various parts of the plants. Before CDRI initiated this programme, there was no systematic effort in India to explore medicinal plants — or other Indian flora — for biological activity. More recently, however, the Department of Indian Systems of Medicine has been created under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which is initiating programmes for the systematic study of traditional remedies. Backed by the strength in traditional Indian systems of medicine, the CDRI programme to develop modern drugs and herbal remedies based on leads from such remedies has provided a major boost to the exploitation of traditional knowledge. In addition, the publication in 1993 of World Health Organization (WHO) research guidelines for safety and efficacy studies of herbal medicines provided a major stimulus to the development of herbal remedies wherever feasible. Initially, the isolation of pure molecules from plants and their further development to “modern” drugs constituted the basic objective of such natural product research. This approach changed when a standardized extract of Commiphora mukul (gugulipid) was developed as a cholesterol-lowering drug by CDRI and approved by the Drugs Controller of India for marketing, as described below. However, in spite of a host of guidelines and regulations issued by national and international agencies for quality assurance of herbal remedies, traditional remedies continue to be manufactured using traditional methods and are marketed without quality controls. Furthermore, there have been few organized efforts to explore plants as a source of modern medicines. The CDRI products detailed in this case study, therefore, are valuable models for the development of such herbal products. The main issues in the development of products from medicinal plants include: The availability of well-identified plant material of good quality and in required quantities can be a limiting factor in developing herbal products. Many medicinal plants are threatened species and cannot be collected from the wild — a practice that is not only detrimental to both the species concerned and the wider environment but also unsustainable for commercial production. The development of appropriate agrotechnology for the cultivation of uniformly high-quality medicinal plants should, therefore, go hand in hand with their development as pharmaceutical products. As the quality of the initial plant material determines the efficacy, safety and shelf life of the finished product, thorough quality control of the plant material — its correct identification, method of collection or harvesting and storage — is essential. To find a place in the global marketplace, products must undergo rigorous safety and efficacy evaluation studies that comply with guidelines prescribed by WHO. Appropriate measures should also be put in place to reward the communities that developed and preserved the knowledge of the use of medicinal plants from generation to generation and that, in many cases, have been responsible for their conservation.",

    "abstract": "Between January 2000 and December 2002, the Chulabhorn Research Institute (CRI) received funding from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to implement a project entitled “Green Health Technology for Women’s Empowerment and Sustainable Development”. Among other components, the project aimed to develop the use of two medicinal plants (Curcuma longa and Andrographis paniculata) for simple illnesses and to promote the cultivation of these plants as a source of additional income. This case study, which illustrates the integration of field and laboratory activities to the benefit of all parties, focuses on A. paniculata (in Thai, “fah thalai jone”). It is generally accepted that, in the case of both modern drugs and herbal drugs, therapeutic efficacy and safety must be proven. In herbal drugs, variations in the levels of active ingredients are well documented and can account for therapeutic ineffectiveness and side effects. Therefore, to promote the use of herbal drugs, scientific intervention is necessary at all steps, starting from good agricultural practices and continuing through good manufacturing practices. The project undertaken by CRI covered both field and laboratory activities in parallel. CRI scientists successfully isolated three major active chemicals from A. paniculata — the diterpenoids andrographolide (AP1), 14-deoxy - 11,12-didehydroandrographolide (AP3) and neoan drographolide (AP4) — and studied their pharmacological and toxicological activities. In addition, a simple and rapid method using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyse these three major chemicals simultaneously was successfully developed. Indeed, HPLC was used throughout the project, for example: • to check the quality of the finished A. paniculata powdered and extracted products; • to study the stability of the A. paniculata products; and • to select the appropriate cultivation period to obtain the maximum levels of the desired active compounds. One of the few side effects observed in some patients using A. paniculata products was the lowering of blood pressure. AP3 was identified as the compound that induced this antihypertensive effect, and it was also found that levels of AP3 in products increased during storage. Therefore, to avoid this side effect, it is advised that crude A. paniculata powdered products be used within one year. Attempts are also being made to determine the cultivation conditions that result in high levels of AP3 and to study the potential of AP3 as an antihypertensive drug. In summary, this project has achieved the following: • identification of the appropriate conditions for the cultivation and harvesting of A. paniculata; Promoting herbal drugs: Thailand 47 • isolation of the pure active diterpenoids; • development of a rapid and simple HPLC method to analyse three bioactive diterpenoids simultaneously; • identification of bioactive compounds that cause a lowering of blood pressure; • estimation of the shelf life of crude A. paniculata powdered drug; • identification, in preliminary studies using water extracts, partially purified extracts and pure diterpenoids, of antimalarial activity and antiplatelet aggregation; and • generation of supplementary income for women participating in the project. The ultimate goal of the Chulabhorn Research Institute (CRI) is to use science and technology to improve people’s quality of life. After the successful organization of the Princess Chulabhorn Science Congress in 1999, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej advised HRH Princess Chulabhorn, president of CRI, to develop a project that would benefit people at the grass-roots level. In response, HRH Princess Chulabhorn held an executive meeting to formulate the project. During this period, CRI was in the process of preparing a project proposal seeking support from UNDP. Therefore, it was decided that the Institute would attempt to use science and technology to improve the quality of life of the people not only through the use of medicinal plants to treat ailments but also through their cultivation to provide a supplementary income for poor families in rural areas. Since 1980, Thailand’s Office of Primary Health Care in the Ministry of Public Health has classified herbal drugs as “essential drugs” that could be used among the strategies to achieve “Health for all by the year 2000”. In the last decade, there has also been a resurgence of interest in herbal medicines in Western societies. With the rapid increase of market demand, cultivation of medicinal plants is obviously needed, especially as many medicinal plants continue to be gathered from wild sources. The first volume of the Thai Herbal Pharmacopoeia, published in 1995, lists specifications and related data concerning the quality of herbal drugs. In 1999, the National Essential Drug List Committee of the Ministry of Public Health released the “National List of Essential Drugs: List of Herbal Medicinal Products”. Curcuma longa and Andrographis paniculata were included on this list. C. longa (turmeric, family Zingiberaceae) was selected because of its wide range of uses in food, cosmetics and health care. The variety that gave the highest yields of the desired volatile oils and curcuminoids was selected for cultivation. The rhizomes are sold as raw materials to the local drug industry. A. paniculata (family Acanthaceae) was selected because it has been widely used to treat the common cold. From personal communications with practitioners of traditional medicine, it was discovered that, in some patients, this plant caused a fall in blood pressure. The scientific literature also shows that A. paniculata has a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities, including antidiarrhoeal, antihepatotoxicity, antimalarial and antiviral (including anti-HIV) activities. It is also active against the common cold and has immunostimulant and cardiovascular activities. At present, more than 20 A. paniculata preparations are available on the local market. Among these, very few are manufactured by using good manufacturing practices. Although the total levels of the active ingredients (diterpenoid lactones) in A. paniculata from different sources are similar, the proportion of each varies depending on the season and time of harvest (fig. 1). To develop a standardized testing procedure, biomarkers for the biologically active compounds are needed. Ideally, a simple and rapid analytical technique should be developed that can be used in the quality control of both the raw materials and finished products and as a means to study the shelf life of products to ensure their safety and therapeutic effectiveness. The project was aimed at assisting both local communities in producing quality raw materials to supplement their income and local manufacturers in producing quality products through the application of science and technology. In addition, the isolated bioactive compounds are being used for further pharmacological and toxicological studies.

    "abstract": "The neem tree (Azadirachta indica) is found throughout the Indian subcontinent. For generations, its seeds, leaves and bark — and the oils extracted from these parts — have been used to treat a variety of ailments. Neem oils have also found uses in agriculture to control various insects and nematodes (parasitic worms). However, little is known about the make-up of neem oil and which parts have the most biological activity. This project was designed to analyse the fatty acids present in neem seed oil. To this end, novel extraction and analytical procedures were developed with a view to developing both more efficient purification processes and commercial products based on these components. The neem tree, which grows throughout the Indian subcontinent, is one of the most important medicinal plants in Bangladesh. The evergreen tree is large, reaching 12 to 18 metres in height with a girth of up to 1.8 to 2.4 metres. Despite almost every part of the tree having a bitter taste, neem has many diverse applications in indigenous medicine. Extracts have been used successfully to treat stomach worms, pyorrhoea (discharges of pus) and ulcers, and they have been reported to possess antidiabetic, antibacterial and antiviral properties. The essential oil extracted from the leaves possesses marked antiseptic and antibacterial properties and, in laboratory tests, inhibits the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causal agent of tuberculosis. The leaves are also used as an insect repellent. The fatty oil extracted from neem seeds also has many therapeutic uses. It possesses antiseptic and antifungal activity and is found to be active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Considerable quantities of the seed oil are employed in cosmetic preparations such as creams, soaps, tooth powders and toothpastes. Tender twigs are used to clean teeth. Given the wide range of uses associated with extracts from the neem tree, there is a need to define which component oils are responsible for which biological activities. Only in this way can the indigenous uses of the neem tree be scientifically validated and commercial products developed that will conform to rigorous international standards. In particular, the project aimed to: • develop an efficient technique for extracting fixed and essential oils from neem seed so that maximum amounts of component fatty acids, including essential fatty acids, can be isolated; • determine whether the fixed seed oil can be used as an edible oil by eliminating bitter-tasting and other components; and Neem seed oil: Bangladesh 61 • develop medicines and hair or body oils by incorporating neemderived components into a benign base such as linseed oil, mustard oil, palmarosa oil, turmeric oil or a combination of these ingredients.",

This interaction has become a major factor in the process of development planning and implementation on all levels: global, regional, national and local. The multiple interactions among the three primary fields – population, environment and development – may be described as a nexus of interrelationships. Few development policymakers and planners have a solid understanding of this nexus and are therefore inclined to neglect or underestimate the systemic effect of their accumulated interactions when crafting development policies, plans and programmes. As a result, sustainable human development is not achieved. The need, therefore, is to build the capacity among policymakers, managers and planners to engage on an intellectual level (i.e., in addition to technical competencies) with the population, environment and development nexus, which has become an imperative for attaining sustainable human development. Due to the fact that leaders, policymakers, managers and planners are not available to attend lengthy training courses, the Government of South Africa, in line with the mandate of its Population Policy, crafted a short course that varies between five and eight days, depending on the specific need, to address this capacity gap and accelerate the mastering South Africa A System Approach to Training in Population, Environment and Development 7 Prof. Cornelius J.

During the 1950s, before Tunisia’s independence, women in the country were largely poor and illiterate. Under the pretext of Islam, women were repressed and treated as secondclass citizens. In the lead-up to Tunisian independence in 1956, however, there were calls from high political levels to ensure fundamental rights for women. Some important changes took place following independence, including a ban on polygamy as stated in the Code of Personal Status and the entrance of women into the economic life of the community and the country, attaining nearly universal education, improved health care and better access to family planning and reproductive health services.

    "abstract": "Uganda has involved its Members of Parliament in promoting reproductive health and family planning issues among the decision makers using evidence-based advocacy as a strategy to influence policy decisions. This approach has transformed a large proportion of the Parliamentarians into active advocates of reproductive health and family planning issues, committed to influencing other decision makers both in Parliament and elsewhere to take actions that bring about desired change in terms of policies, programmes, strategies and allocation of resources. Evidence-based advocacy as an approach seeks to equip selected advocates with data and information to be used in drawing the attention of decision makers to socio-economic realities on the ground. The aim is to inform them, motivate them, persuade them and prompt them to take actions that address the issues so identified. A comparative analysis of the situation before and after the introduction of this evidencebased advocacy initiative indicates that Uganda has, through this innovation, managed to put population and development issues in general and reproductive health and family planning issues in particular high on the policy, public and media agendas. Key indicators used as evidence included low life expectancy, a high population growth rate, a high total fertility rate, a high maternal mortality ratio, low contraceptive use, a high unmet need for family planning, and high incidences of unintended pregnancy and induced abortion as well as high levels of poverty. Uganda Involving Parliamentarians as Advocates for Reproductive Health 10 Mr. Hannington Burunde Summary (continued) The link between these indicators and the overall socio-economic development was also highlighted. The implications of these indicators for the provision of social services such as health, education, water and sanitation, employment and housing and for the government efforts to eradicate poverty and to achieve the national vision of social transformation were also highlighted to emphasize the need for policy action. Apparently these implications had, in the past, not been brought to the attention of Parliamentarians and other decision makers so that they would be sufficiently informed, motivated, persuaded and prompted to take appropriate policy actions. As such, reproductive health and family planning issues had remained largely unattended to and were placed low on the policy and funding agendas. Evidence-based advocacy as a practice was therefore conceived as an appropriate strategy primarily to create a substantial number of Members of Parliament who would be convinced and committed to bringing these issues onto the floor of Parliament in order for other Parliamentarians to appreciate the realities on the ground and to take policy actions that would bring about desired change. The Parliamentarians were also prepared and equipped to take the message to other decision makers at national and subnational levels who might not be members of Parliament but who were in positions of leadership. An elaborate implementation modality was put in place and tools and materials were developed to guide the entire initiative. These included the development of the Advocacy Subprogramme as part of the Country Population Programme and the formulation of the National Advocacy Strategy and the Media Advocacy Strategy within the framework of the National Population Policy. The Advocacy Training of Trainers Curriculum and Manual in Support of Population Programmes was also developed to guide the capacity-building process. The Members of Parliament were then identified and recruited, sensitized and equipped with advocacy skills and instruments to prepare them to become actively involved in advocacy-based events and to assist them to use various forums to advocate for reproductive health and family planning issues whenever opportunities arose. After a period of about ten years, there are new developments to show that evidence-based advocacy through Parliamentarians is a good practice that can influence a policy agenda in great measure. Statements by decision makers show that the messages of the Parliamentarians have been taken on board and are the basis for a number of decisions in various sectors and at various levels including district and lower levels. The integration of population factors into the development plans at national and district levels are a clear manifestation of this initiative. The practice has to a great extent become self-sustaining, with decision makers expressing concern over the people-centred issues and calling for quick action to address them. Despite the challenges encountered, it is apparent that the replicability and spreadability of this practice can benefit many other countries and institutions as a lesson from which to draw in their effort to promote reproductive health and family planning as well as prompt policy action and resource allocation. Involving Parliamentarians as Advocates for Reproductive Health – Uganda 231 Uganda has been implementing evidencebased advocacy through Parliamentarians since 2001 to influence decision makers at various levels to advocate for putting in place policies, programmes and strategies that address reproductive health concerns of the country and to mobilize the necessary resources and prioritize their allocation for implementation of the interventions. The main target has been the members of the country’s legislative body: the Parliament. Parliamentarians make policies and endorse decisions that guide government implementing agencies and other stakeholders in addressing the socio-economic needs and the management of society. In addition to legislation, Parliamentarians represent the views of their constituencies, which cut across sectors of the population, including the grass-roots level. They are elected leaders, they are trusted and they are seen to represent the desires, aspirations and interests of the majority of their constituents. They also play a central role in budget appropriation and oversight. Over time, evidence-based advocacy as a practice has enabled Uganda to transform a large proportion of the Members of Parliament from mere politicians into active advocates of reproductive health and family planning issues and to have a strong lobbying group in Parliament to champion population and development concerns of the country. Evidence-based advocacy was conceived as the best practice for promoting population and development issues in general and reproductive health issues in particular after it was realized that these were not priorities on the policy, public, media and development partners’ agendas. It was introduced to influence government policies and programmes to address population trends and patterns and to mobilize and allocate resources to implement them. Uganda has one of the highest population growth rates in the world and the root cause of this is linked to the lack of prioritization of reproductive health issues in government policies and programmes. Population and development factors cover a broad spectrum of issues that include reproductive health, gender and demographic challenges. Evidence-based advocacy is a cross-cutting intervention that aims at attracting the attention of decision makers at various levels not only to be informed about such issues but to also develop an interest in them and become convinced enough to take the necessary investment and policy actions.",

Beyond this discussion, however, the international community must also be made aware of the concrete results from the implementation of social protection measures. These measures, which resulted in the acceleration of poverty reduction, match the policy objectives of the Social Protection Floor Initiative proposed by the United Nations and, ultimately, dignify the elderly in the Plurinational State of Bolivia. For the Plurinational State of Bolivia, now being able to guarantee a social protection floor for the elderly has been one of the most important and far-reaching",

This does not prevent them from contributing on a voluntary basis and as an individual contributor in order to obtain benefits higher than the minimum. • The rural producer who is a physical person contributes on the basis of commercialized product (2.1 per cent corresponding to the employer’s quota) and on the basis of income declared as an individual contributor (the personal quota).  The value of this income will always be at least equal to the minimum wage and the contribution will be 11 per cent. • Like the urban worker, the salaried rural worker contributes 8 per cent, 9 per cent or 10 per cent of his/her monthly income. • The rural producer who is a legal person contributes 2.6 per cent of the value of the product commercialized.

The document outlined a very broad set of needs without focusing on precise, prioritized and realistic objectives. 2008: Start of the universal health insurance project. 2009: The authorities progressively became aware of the need for a national policy on social protection that would frame all the various initiatives. That is how Burkina Faso came to take an interest in the concept of the social protection floor and initiated a process for mainstreaming and consolidating initiatives to promote access to basic social services for all, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable. The country took steps in September 2009, through the Prime Minister, to request that the United Nations Social Protection Floor Initiative support the Government in launching a process to build a social protection floor in Burkina Faso. 2010: Establishment of an inter-ministerial committee responsible for driving efforts to develop a national policy on social protection that sets out a road map presenting the global vision on social protection in Burkina Faso and sets its objectives, its priority areas and its monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The inter-ministerial committee must coordinate efforts to build a global, streamlined national policy. Steps in the process of building a national policy based on a social protection floor: 1. Build capacity of national actors; 2. Design a global vision for social protection; 3. Create synergy among the respective programmes; 4. Agree on the criteria for defining poverty and vulnerability and put in place efficient targeting mechanisms; 5. Put in place a statistical information system on social protection, building on robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms; and 6. Develop innovative mechanisms for increasing financing for the social protection sector. 5 Burkina Faso Marie Eugénie Malgoubri Kyendrebeogo Inousa Ouiminga Olivier Louis dit Guérin",

Five objectives and key interventions (based on the vulnerability and gap analysis and consultation process in 2009 and 2010): 1. The poor and vulnerable receive support to meet their basic needs, including food, sanitation, water and shelter in times of emergency and crisis. 2. Poor and vulnerable children and mothers benefit from social safety nets to alleviate poverty and enhance the development of human capital by improving nutrition as well as maternal and child health, promoting education and eliminating child labour, especially its worst forms. 3. The working-age poor and vulnerable benefit from work opportunities to secure income, food and livelihoods while contributing to the creation of sustainable physical and social infrastructure assets. 4. The poor and vulnerable have effective access to affordable, quality health care and financial protection in case of sickness or illness. 5. Special vulnerable groups, including orphans, the elderly, single women with children, people living with disabilities, and people living with HIV and tuberculosis, receive income, in-kind and psycho-social support, and adequate social care.

    "abstract": "The rural New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) and the Medical Assistance Scheme (MAS) have been established separately since 2002. They are the main medical security schemes targeting rural residents and the poor in China. Rural New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS): • Target population: all rural residents; • Enrolment: on a voluntary basis; • Provides reimbursements for enrollees’ health spending on inpatient care, outpatient service, some selected catastrophic diseases, pregnancy’s institutional delivery, and physical examinations. The approximate reimbursement rate of inpatient care was 39.82 per cent in 2009; • 833 million enrollees by the end of 2009; the enrolment rate was 94 per cent of the target population and about 62 per cent of the whole population in China; • Has a multi-channel financing mechanism. Both central and local governments subsidize the enrollees. The households of the enrolled farmers also contribute. Donations from the social sector constitute another funding source. Medical Assistance Scheme (MAS): • Target population: the rural poor; • Provides financial assistance as well as exemptions for catastrophic health expenditures and some frequently occurring diseases for the poor and low-income groups; • Funds come mainly from government revenue (central and local governments, including public welfare lottery) and from social-sector donations. Both Schemes have made great improvements in helping rural households, especially rural poor households, to cope with the financial burden from combating disease. The proportion of out-of-pocket expenditure has come down from nearly 80 per cent to about 60 per cent. Farmers’ out-of-pocket spending as a share of per capita net income decreased from 74 per cent to 44 per cent with the introduction of the Schemes. However, out-of-pocket share of inpatient cost is still as high (approximately 60 per cent, 70 per cent several years ago), which is beyond the affordability of the poor. Thus, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) alone cannot solve the issue of accessibility and equity for the poor. In fact, among its members, the poor use many fewer services than 8 ChinaZhengzhong Mao Wei Fu Xuefei Gu Yuanping Wang Summary (cont’d.) the non-poor. This situation will not change unless the Medical Assistance Scheme (MAS) becomes integrated with the NCMS and pays all or part of the co-payment for the poor so that their out-of-pocket share can drop to 20 per cent or below. In 2009, total NCMS expenditure was about 92.29 billion yuan and MAS expenditure was about 5.99 billion yuan. Compared to the overall GDP (33,535.3 billion yuan), however, NCMS and MAS expenditures are inappreciable.

Subsidized Health Insurance Scheme: • Target group: Poor or informal workers; • Selection of eligible poor and informal workers by the municipal authorities through a proxy means test; • Financing: general taxes collected by the national government and transferred to the municipalities, reinforced by departmental and municipal contributions plus the transfer of 1.5 per cent of total collections from the contributive system. 9 ColombiaElisa Carolina Torrenegra Cabrera Colombia’s subsidized regime has its origins in the 1990s, a decade when international trends were based on the promotion of solidarity concepts, community participation, access to rural health services, selfmanagement of health, health promotion and development through community participation, prevention in health care, and a focus on poor and vulnerable populations. In Colombia, these global trends were consolidated through the establishment of the health plans serving the subsidized population (the Health Solidarity Organizations Programme (Programa de Empresas Solidarias de Salud, ESS). Established by the national government with support from the Inter-American Development Bank, these plans incorporated the public health policy concepts that were already accepted internationally and promulgated in the discussion, analysis and decision-making processes of health systems around the world. This programme improved the organizing of rural communities and communities with a lower socio-economic status, empowering and teaching them how to manage their health themselves and promoting the adoption of healthy lifestyles. These concepts initiated the establishment of a Colombian health system that would facilitate the improvement of the population’s living conditions. In the 1990s, the country had a total health expenditure of approximately 6.2 per cent of the integrated gross domestic product (GDP) (table 1), comprising mainly out-of-pocket expenditure, which accounted for more than 3 percentage points and had a significant impact on poverty levels (see also table 2 for per capita expenditure on health).",

    "abstract": "Wage employment programme, implemented in a phased manner (2006-2008). Rights-based legal guarantee. Target group: households in rural areas. Employment provided: 52.5 million households (2009-2010). Benefit: providing at least 100 days of employment in asset-creating public works programmes every year at the minimum wage for every rural household whose adults volunteer to do unskilled manual work for the enhancement of livelihood security. Delivery process: Adult members of a rural household may apply to the local gram panchayat (local government at the village or small-town level) for registration and, in return, receive a job card, which is the basic legal document that enables a rural household to demand work. Employment must be provided within 15 days of demand within a 5-kilometre radius of the village (or else extra wages of 10 per cent must be paid) or else an unemployment allowance must be paid by the State at its own cost. Funding: Under this Act, the central government meets the cost towards the payment of wages while State governments meet the cost of the unemployment allowance. 12 IndiaAmita Sharma",

    "abstract": "Mozambique recently approved the National Strategy for Basic Social Security (April 2010) and the Regulation for Basic Social Security (December 2009) that set the stage for a comprehensive model that can be seen as another step in the direction of a national social protection floor (SPF). Earlier in 2007, the Social Protection Law (4/2007) took the first step, organizing the social protection system at three levels: basic social security, obligatory social security and complementary social security. Therefore, the legal framework creates an inclusive juridical foundation, establishing a mix of funding mechanisms (both contributory and non-contributory) and offering a set of potential benefits and mechanisms aligned with the SPF definition. The Regulation is a step forward, protecting key rights, establishing universalization as a goal, but also noting that the expansion of social protection will be gradual in accordance with government capacity. The Regulation for Basic Social Security divides basic social security into four areas of intervention that are very relevant to the social protection floor: • direct social action. Managed by the Ministry of Women and Social Action, it comprises social transfers used to address the needs of the most vulnerable (older people, people with disabilities, those who are chronically ill, and households with orphans and vulnerable children) and to respond to situations of transitory vulnerability; • health social action. Managed by the Ministry of Health, it assures the universal access of the most vulnerable populations to primary health care; • education social action. Managed by the Ministry of Education, it promotes the participation of the most vulnerable populations in the education system; and • productive social action. Jointly managed by different sectors and including Social Inclusion through Work programmes, it targets female heads of households, people with disabilities and other people living in absolute poverty. The approval of the Regulation for Basic Social Security constitutes a very significant step towards the implementation of the social protection floor in Mozambique, but it also raises a major challenge considering the institutional capacity of the national organizations involved. Important items for discussion are efficiency of the programmes, definition of priorities, funding of the Strategy and fiscal space. Mozambique has recently approved a strategy (the National Strategy for Basic Social Security) and a regulation (Decree nr. 85/2009) that establishes the Regulation for the Basic Social Security Subsystem. The latter, together with Law 4/2007 (the Social Protection Law) and the Regulation for Obligatory Social Security, creates the basis for a comprehensive model that can be seen as a step in the direction of a social protection floor. This legal framework creates an inclusive juridical foundation, establishing a mix of funding mechanisms (both contributory and non-contributory) and offering a set of potential benefits and mechanisms aligned with the definition of a social protection floor. The Regulation for the Basic Social Security Subsystem is a step forward, protecting key rights, establishing universalization as a goal, but also noting that the expansion of social protection will be gradual in accordance with government capacity. Indeed, as a result of the approval of the new Regulation, Mozambique now has a very comprehensive set of legal instruments. On one hand, the Social Protection Law establishes three pillars of protection: non-contributory basic social security, contributory or obligatory social security, and complementary private insurance. On the other hand, the Regulation for the Basic Social Security Subsystem defines four areas of intervention: direct social action (monetary and in-kind transfers), health social action, education social action and productive social action. In addition, the Regulation for Obligatory Social Security foresees the extension of the social insurance mechanisms to the self-employed. The three pillars of protection provide a diversified range of solutions for the extension of social security coverage and for the development of a social protection floor. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that while being an important step, the existence of a good legal framework is not a sufficient condition for the successful implementation of a social protection floor. This case study will focus on the most recent advances in the area of basic social security that target the most vulnerable populations, establishing “a set of essential social rights and transfers” as specified in the definition of the Social Protection Floor Initiative.",

    "abstract": "In order to reduce poverty among the population and to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Government of Rwanda is elaborating and implementing different schemes and interventions in the social protection sector. This sector has developed and evolved a great deal in the last 10 years, with an increasing role to play in poverty reduction. After elaborating a social protection policy in 2005 and having commissioned a Public Expenditure Review (PER) in 2006, the Government identified social protection as one of the priority sectors in the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy of 2007. Various programmes have been set up by different institutions to contribute to poverty reduction and the improvement of Rwandans’ living conditions. In the health sector, different schemes co-exist and complement one another. For the formal sector, the Rwanda Health Insurance Scheme (la Rwandaise d’assurance maladie, RAMA), Military Medical Insurance (MMI) and private insurance companies cover, respectively, the civil servants, members of the Rwanda Defence Force and their immediate families, and employees of private companies. All formal-sector workers are also part of the Social Security Fund of Rwanda (SSFR) for occupational hazards. The informal sector and rural populations are members of other schemes, called community-based health insurance schemes (mutuelles de santé). These schemes cover 91 per cent of the population in 2010. In the education sector, all Rwandans can benefit from free basic education (nine years). A programme is also supporting some vulnerable groups to access housing. In addition to these schemes, there are some other social transfers. Among them, formalsector employees contribute for their pension. A flagship programme was also developed as part of the Rwanda Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy: the Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme (VUP). It has three components: public works, direct support and financial services. This Programme has shown results in reducing poverty among beneficiaries. Another Rwandan initiative is the Ubudehe programme and approach (community targeting/classification through social mapping). To support the genocide survivors, the Fund for the Support and Assistance to the Survivors of the Tutsi Genocide and Other Crimes against Humanity was established and supported them in different areas (housing, education, health, social assistance, income-generating activities). To contribute to the reintegration of demobilized soldiers, the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission has developed programmes to support this specific group.  A project also contributed to the improvement of livelihoods, soil fertility and nutrition status through providing a dairy cow to poor families. This case study presents the social protection sector in Rwanda and its development over the last five years. Following a description of the socioeconomic situation in the country, the case study focuses on the evolution of social protection. Several main programmes are then discussed to show the current situation and implementation of social protection in Rwanda. The third part of the case study presents the new strategy and way forward for the next 20 years. Rwanda is a landlocked country with a population of about 10 million that is situated in central Africa. It is one of the continent’s most densely populated countries, with up to 467 people per square kilometre. The population is comprised mainly of young persons; in 2005, people under 25 years of age accounted for two thirds of the population. Rwanda is facing a challenge with its population growth. With a total fertility rate of 6.1 in 2005 combined with a decline in infant mortality, it has one of the highest population growth rates in Africa (around 2.7 per cent per year). Summary (cont’d.) Other vulnerable groups such as the disabled and orphans and vulnerable children are also targeted by some of these interventions and also benefit from other interventions. There are different coordination mechanisms at different levels in Rwanda to improve the efficiency and impact of interventions in the social protection sector. A social protection strategy is being developed in 2010 and discussions are ongoing before its final approval. This case study focuses on several interventions centred on improvement and harmonization where possible to improve the social protection for Rwanda’s population.",

This component has produced numerous innovative experiences that may be applicable in future post-conflict development scenarios across the globe. Community-based methods have been used to work with newly created community development councils (freely elected community leadership councils) to define, plan and guide the implementation of CBNRM projects. As a result, the activities of the CBNRM component have produced positive livelihood-oriented changes in the local socio-environmental contexts of participating villages in post-conflict Afghanistan at minimal cost and with maximum ownership by the village participants. By empowering newly elected community leaders to define the needs and capacities of their villages and to manage the mobilization of the community for project implementation, CBNRM projects have facilitated the development of nascent local democratic institutions. Furthermore, by placing the responsibility for the design and implementation of the respective projects on each community, CBNRM projects have solidified community ownership, allowing communities to demonstrate to themselves and to their neighbours that they possess the skills, abilities and motivation to make a positive, lasting impact on their local environment while enhancing the livelihood basis of their community and providing for a more sustainable future. Lastly, by engaging in projects with individual communities as a motivating factor to mobilize inter-community resource management, UNEP has been able to address longstanding natural-resource management issues, such as rangeland management, that would have been difficult if not impossible for single-village-oriented projects to achieve.",

    "abstract": "From an economic point of view, Bangladesh is a developing country but one that is rich in natural and human resources. Coordination and cooperation between experts are needed to make the best use of its natural resources. The expansion of human resources in diverse fields must be given the highest priority to encourage sustainable economic development on many fronts. In Bangladesh, science and technology are fields that are dominated by men and have become directed towards the perspectives and needs of men. Culturally, women are discouraged from studying science and technology. Before embarking on this project, the Association for Advancement of Information Technology (AAIT) conducted a survey in 36 science and technology institutes and research organizations in the country that showed that the number of female scientists and lecturers was 12 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively. Apart from promoting equal working opportunities for women, a basic knowledge of science and technology would also enhance the traditional role of women as mothers, social educators and transmitters of ideas and knowledge from generation to generation. A significant number of scientists, technologists, researchers, social workers and medical professionals in Bangladesh are women who are well qualified and experienced in their respective fields but who are less aware than men of the potential benefits of information and communication technology (ICT) as a result of lack of access since parents and guardians prefer not to invest in girls’ education. In this context, a project was conceived by AAIT in early 1996, and during 1997, AAIT organized ICT training courses for women. These courses were designed to be relevant to the jobs and career aspirations of the participants and to the needs of regional communities. They were held at universities in the capital city, Dhaka, as well as in regional towns. Two regional courses were organized specifically for female medical professionals working in rural clinics, hospitals and health-care centres throughout Bangladesh. The training courses were particularly suitable for relatively marginalized groups and remote communities in a developing country; being low in cost and using local organizers and trainers, they were designed to meet the needs of the participants. Follow-up was carried out in situ, with AAIT experts visiting the participants’ workplaces every one to two months to see how the ICT knowledge acquired was being used in their respective fields and to offer technical support.",

    "abstract": "Widespread and severe contamination of drinking water with arsenic is a significant health problem in rural areas of Bangladesh (fig. 1). More than 90 per cent of rural households depend on groundwater for water for drinking and other domestic uses. Screening of 4.7 million tube wells in arsenic-affected upazilas or subdistricts (the lowest level of administrative government in Bangladesh) has shown that water in 29 per cent of these wells (mainly in the south of the country) contained arsenic at concentrations in excess of the Bangladesh standard for safe drinking water. An estimated 20 million to 25 million people in these areas are thus at risk from arsenic poisoning. In addition, more than 10,000 people suffering from chronic arsenic poisoning were identified between 1991 and 2001 in different studies (British Geological Survey, 2001). The first effects of long-term exposure are seen in the skin as pigmentation changes and thickening (hyperkeratosis), while exposure for more than 10 years is associated with an increased risk of cancers of the skin, lungs, bladder and kidneys. The Department of Public Health and Engineering (DPHE) instigated a pilot initiative to identify vulnerable communities in areas highly affected by arsenic contamination, to deploy alternative safe water options for ensuring arsenic-free drinking water, and to conduct awareness programmes among the rural people. This initiative was carried out by the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS), with financial assistance from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Created in 2002, CEGIS is an independent scientific centre of excellence that supports the management of natural resources for sustainable socio-economic development via integrated environmental analysis, geographical information science, remote sensing and database and information technology. The major objectives of this initiative were to: • develop the Arsenic Decision Support System (ADSS), a soft Figure 1 Map showing areas of Bangladesh that are contaminated with arsenic and study areas. Identifying and Improving Awareness of Communities Vulnerable to Arsenic Contamination – Bangladesh 41 ware programme designed to identify and map areas where arsenic contamination renders drinking water unsafe, and create an extended database of measurements of arsenic concentrations in tube wells; • use ADSS to identify the most vulnerable communities; • raise awareness among affected communities; and • promote capacity-building among field-level officials in DPHE to enable the sustainable deployment of the initiative as part of mitigation planning activities to protect the people of rural Bangladesh from arsenic poisoning. The project demonstrated that the decision support system developed will assist DPHE in identifying the most vulnerable communities, prioritizing planning and optimizing budgeting for ongoing arsenic mitigation work, and increasing awareness among people living in rural areas affected by arsenic contamination.",

    "abstract": "Generating high-quality competitive products for export is a challenge for many African countries. Recent human health and safety concerns have resulted in more stringent technical barriers to trade and sanitary and phytosanitary standards. These non-tariff restrictions are used by governments to protect the health of the consumer. The application of sanitary and phytosanitary standards and technical barriers to trade provides quality assurance for consumers but may isolate producers from international markets owing to non-compliance and lack of expertise. Research and training to ensure compliance with quality standards and improve the capacity of African exporters to understand and respond to these technical barriers are important for trade competitiveness. More specifically, developing good agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices is a key requirement for increasing access to export markets. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has developed a pilot project with a regional perspective in Benin and Ghana that will subsequently be extended to other West African countries. The project focuses on two levels of capacity-building: • empowering the primary producers (i.e., farmers, processors and traders) with regard to good agricultural practices, and food-quality and food-safety control measures; and • training managerial staff (including scientists, business managers and policymakers) in food-quality and -safety regulations and the assessment of their impact on trade and regional economic growth. During the project, partnerships will be established with international researchfor-development institutions in order to strengthen capacity in Africa for compliance with international standards for foodproduct quality and the promotion of trade. Public and private institutions, consumer organizations and non-governmental organizations will be closely associated in these capacity-building efforts either as targets or suppliers of training services. The pilot project will reinforce the roles of IITA and the Regional Office for Africa of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) based in Accra, Ghana, as regional centres of excellence for capacitybuilding in the field of quality control of food products and the evaluation of the impact of technical barriers to trade and sanitary and phytosanitary standards on trade in West Africa.",

    "abstract": "Science-and-technology policy came to the formal agenda of the Government of Brazil during the 1970s with the elaboration and implementation of several National Development Plans. Since that time, the institutions and government bodies dealing with the creation, coordination, financing and execution of scientific, technological and innovative activities have been developed and strengthened. This scientific and technological framework has allowed the country to achieve outstanding advances on several fronts when compared with many other developing countries. In terms of the availability of highly qualified personnel (with respect to training and scientific production), the performance of Brazil is much more robust and competitive than it was 20 years ago. However, gaps still persist, mainly in relation to the poor uptake of highly qualified human resources by the industrial sector, thus limiting innovation and socio-economic development. To overcome such constraints, Research and Projects Financing (FINEP), also known as the Brazilian Innovation Agency, a publicly owned company linked to the Ministry of Science and Technology, launched the Programme for Supporting Research in Enterprises (PAPPE) in 2003. This Programme aims to stimulate the assimilation of highly qualified human resources into companies, especially micro-, small- and mediumsized enterprises (MSMEs), and to encourage the creation of MSMEs by researchers. Results include: • implementation of the Programme in 20 out of 27 States of the Brazilian federation to date; • investment of $64 million shared (38:26) between federal and State sources; • undertaking of 606 research projects by researchers in 549 MSMEs in the fields of agrobusiness, biotechnology, energy, health and informatics; • promotion of cohesion and the convergence of policy objectives among several agents of the national science, technology and innovation system; • strengthening of links between different agents (such as federal and State agencies offering financial support and researchers at universities and enterprises); • promotion of long-term strategies; and • integration of science and technology with the industrial sector.",

    "abstract": "Researchers at the Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute (CAREERI) have implemented integrated river-basin management strategies in arid inland river basins of northwest China using the Heihe River Basin as a case study. The Heihe River Basin, which spans the border between Qinghai and Gansu provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, covers an area of nearly 130,000 square kilometres, making it the second largest inland river basin in the arid area of northwest China. The basin includes three major topographic landscapes: the Qilian Mountains in the upper reaches, the Hexi Corridor in the middle reaches and the Alxa highlands in the lower reaches. The Qilian Mountains, where rainfall is highest, are the catchment or run-off-producing areas while the basins, which receive less frequent precipitation, are run-off-absorbing areas. Because they differ greatly in economic structure and water-use practices, the three provinces served by the Heihe River Basin face serious water conflicts and benefitsharing is complex. At the government level, a Master Plan for the Heihe River Basin (MPHRB), the aim of which was to allow an adequate volume of water to reach the lower parts of the river, was initiated in 1992 and revised in 1997 and 2000. A basin-wide management organization, the Heihe River Basin Administrative Bureau, was established in 2000 and is responsible for the management of water resources in the basin and the implementation, operation and maintenance of large-scale water projects. However, the complex problems in the area – including providing access to irrigation water for a large number of farmers – could not be solved solely through government intervention and focusing on water issues alone. Therefore CAREERI, in association with local governments and communities, implemented an integrated project incorporating water, ecological and economic aspects on a river-basin scale in the Heihe River Basin. In this project, intensive water-saving measures were tested in the middle basin in order to increase water productivity, that is, to gain greater benefits per drop of water used. The use of water-rights cards and water tickets by farmers and other stakeholders was piloted in the irrigation districts. At the community level, the establishment of an association for water users and improved price transparency reduced farmer conflicts and promoted the protection of irrigation facilities. To sustain the increased river discharge required to maintain the fragile ecology of the lower river basin, many activities such as the production of cash crops, stall-feeding of livestock and ecotourism have been demonstrated and extended as new income-generating alternatives for local farmers and Mongolian herders. Moreover, an integrated mountain-valley-oasis system on a river-basin scale, including stall-feeding, deferring grazing, fodder production and the processing of agricultural products, has been initiated and demonstrated to maximize regional resources. Particular successes were achieved in persuading communities to participate in water-saving schemes, increasing incomes and rehabilitating the ecology of the basin. Efforts to establish close collaboration among research institutes, local government and communities were also successful. The project also promoted research-based solutions to critical problems that were demonstrated and extended in practice by involving and training local government and community representatives. In turn, their capacity to develop their local environment on a sustainable basis has been improved.",

    "abstract": "The idea that developing countries have an urgent need to create their own scientific capacity as a prerequisite for economic and social development is supported by many international agencies. However, it was probably best expressed by Abdus Salam, Nobel Prize winner and founder of TWAS, the academy of sciences for the developing world, throughout his writings. Despite this, very few developing countries have given much priority to science. Instead, most efforts towards economic development have been devoted to industrial infrastructure. Within this framework, most technology-transfer efforts have failed to have any lasting impact on local development. With the early establishment of an academy of science, with steady and continued political will and with the effective use of international scientific and educational exchange, Cuba has managed to acquire, in a relatively short time, a fairly sophisticated scientific establishment that not only has had a direct impact on improving the living standards of its population compared with those of many other countries in the region but also is contributing to the support of development efforts abroad. The positive results of Cuban efforts towards economic, social and cultural development are shown by indicators in many fields that compare favourably today with those of developed countries. During the past 50 years, only a few developing countries have been able to reduce the gap in economic and social development that exists between rich and poor nations. The success of Cuba, as measured by these indicators, can be attributed to the direct application of science and technology to solve local problems, maintaining international cooperation in science as a high priority.",

    "abstract": "Mushroom cultivation is a new activity in Ethiopia. As well as being a method of bioconversion of non-edible plant biomass into nutritious food, mushrooms are a cash crop, the market for which is growing worldwide. While wild mushrooms are harvested in forests in Ethiopia during the rainy season, they are not a staple part of the diet and were not cultivated previously. Research on mushroom cultivation in Ethiopia started in 1993 at the Department of Biology, Addis Ababa University. Agricultural and agroindustrial waste and other cellulose-rich materials available in the country were investigated for production of the three most commonly cultivated mushrooms: Agaricus bisporus (button mushroom), Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) and Lentinula edodes (shiitake mushroom). Appropriate methods of spawn production, substrate preparation, composting and mushroom growing under existing environmental conditions have been achieved. The outcomes of the research project undertaken in the Department of Biology have provided the basis for the establishment of small-scale commercial mushroom enterprises in and around Addis Ababa. The most successful of these, the Africa Mushroom Company, is the first private enterprise to supply fresh edible mushrooms to the Addis Ababa market throughout the year. The company has gradually gained experience in the technology of cultivation as well as the training of technicians capable of managing the mushroom farm. The waste generated, the spent compost, is used as organic fertilizer for growing vegetables and tree seedlings. This project has shown that sustainable and environmentally friendly small-scale mushroom production is feasible in Ethiopia.",

The aim of this initiative is to build scientific, technological and human capacity for the generation and use of bio-diesel as an alternative to petroleum-based fuel products. The strategic advantages of using bio-diesel are many: it is a renewable source of energy (derived from inedible vegetable oils), it is ecologically friendly and less polluting than petrol, and it could make a significant contribution to energy security in India. Some States in India (e.g., Andhra Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Orissa,) have already launched efforts to produce bio-diesel. A unique approach in the Bio-diesel Energy Systems and Technology entrepreneurial venture has been the creation of a sustainable privatepublic partnership between Bio-diesel Energy Systems and Technology, the Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology, the Ministry of Nonconventional Energy Sources and Rotary Electronics Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, a small/ medium-sized enterprise that exercises corporate social responsibility. The Bio-diesel Energy Systems and Technology project aims to identify and evaluate the value chain and to develop a viable business plan that considers the potential political, economic and trade risks involved in the steps to be taken towards the sustainable generation and use of bio-diesel as an alternative “clean” fuel. Such steps include: • the acquisition of land for plantation and cultivation of oilseed feedstock; • the development of efficient technologies for the conversion of the vegetable oils extracted from the oilseed to bio-diesel via an esterification process; and • the assessment of the economic, social and environmental impact of large-scale production of biodiesel through public distribution and private for-profit channels.",

    "abstract": "The project, “Capacity-building on wastewater valorization for agricultural production in the Middle East area by using cost-effective treatment technologies” (WASTEVAL), aimed to build capacity with respect to the development and proper application of low-cost wastewater treatment and recovery methods. The ultimate goal was to increase agricultural production by the safe and economical application of treated wastewater for irrigation and fertilization in arid areas. Capacity-building targeted human resources and technological aspects in Egypt, Jordan and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The WASTEVAL project has been responsible for training specialized staff in the low-cost treatment of wastewater and water-reuse technologies, including 6 Doctors of Philosophy (PhDs) and 20 Master of Science (MSc) graduates as well as several PhD supervisers. Sandwich doctoral programmes, in which part of each year was spent abroad, were implemented with the Netherlands as the counterpart country and resulted in the development of research stations and specialized laboratories in partner countries, enabling trained staff to continue their research in their home country after graduation. The scientific research carried out targeted local problems and the results obtained were disseminated via technical and scientific publications. In addition, the University of Jordan (Jordan) and Birzeit University (Occupied Palestinian Territory) developed curricula for specialized courses. The sustainability of the project was ensured mainly by the fixed positions of the newly upgraded staff in partner countries, who became more involved in the issue of using unconventional water resources in irrigation. The project also succeeded in raising awareness concerning low-cost treatment technologies among government and private-sector professionals attending several short courses, workshops and seminars that were organized in partner countries. The organized workshops also enhanced South-South knowledge exchange and produced an active network. The network thus formed ensured the continuation of cooperation between partners via the submission of new research projects to the European Union. Low-cost treatment technologies researched under the project are now being applied in some rural areas in Egypt and are being considered among options for wastewater treatment in Jordan.",

The pilot project, “Strengthening agricultural and environmental capacity through distance education (SAEC-DE) and locally relevant research”, provides opportunities for postgraduate candidates in East African countries to obtain a Master of Science (MSc) degree at the University of Florida, which offers distanceeducation programmes in agriculture and environmental sciences. The collaboration also aims to develop similar programmes at the University of Nairobi and Makerere University. After a one-semester testing phase in the autumn of 2005, four candidates were enrolled (two each from Nairobi and Makerere) in courses on environmental soil science or agricultural entomology that began in the spring of 2006. The main mode of content delivery is the Internet. The students must also carry out locally relevant research under the joint supervision of university professors and Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) researchers (CIAT forms part of this network), thus acquiring internationally recognized training. The collaboration offers a viable alternative to traditional postgraduate education and research by lowering education costs, increasing professional retention, and not removing trainees from their professional roles or homes for extended periods. This initiative pioneers information and communication technology (ICT)-based postgraduate training in agricultural and environmental education in the region. It is expected that beneficiaries will contribute to increased agricultural production and development in their countries and hence to the alleviation of poverty and the improvement of food security.

    "abstract": "This case study describes a one-year pilot project in which farmers in Kenya were provided with access to information on the control and management of pests and diseases by non-chemical methods, this information being accessed via information and communication technology (ICT). The aim of the project was to raise awareness of inexpensive, safe and environmentally sound alternatives to commercially available chemical pesticides in order to increase food production at the household level. The project, initiated in 2005, was implemented by a partnership that involved international agencies, regional networks, government departments, local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations and farmer groups. More specifically, the Arid Lands Information Network-East Africa, a network of community development workers, formed a partnership with Pesticide Action Network Germany (PAN Germany), Participatory Ecological Land Use Management-Kenya, the Ministry of Agriculture, Mwingi District and the Kyuso farming community. Together these partners have piloted and prepared large-scale access to an online database of pest-control information among smallholder farmers and agricultural training and extension networks in Africa. As part of the pilot project, a resource centre for farmers, or “information supermarket”, was established at Kyuso, Kenya. From this centre, farmers could access the Online Information Service for Non-chemical Pest Management in the Tropics (OISAT Info) and other information resources on CD-ROM and the Internet using general packet radio service (GPRS) technology. To enhance the widespread sharing of local knowledge and agricultural practices, the Arid Lands Information Network-East Africa also installed Open Knowledge Network software, an offline communication channel. The project is highly valued by the local farming community, agricultural extension workers, teachers and students from neighbouring educational institutions, and local leaders who have been able to access appropriate, practical and up-to-date information resources. Local farmers now control and manage pests more inexpensively, thus reducing production costs. In addition, capacity relating to the use of appropriate ICTs and communication skills has increased among farmers and extension teams.",

    "abstract": "About 60 per cent of the land area of East Africa is occupied by drylands, which are recognized internationally for the diversity of their indigenous flora and fauna. However, factors such as population growth, drought and famine have meant that societies that traditionally maintained and preserved this biodiversity – including communities with nomadic lifestyles – are now exposing the land to unsustainable management practices. Although the living conditions of many dryland communities have become desperate, such communities have not hitherto been able to attract investment from national or international development portfolios. The Regional Programme on Sustainable Use of Dryland Biodiversity was constituted as a response to challenges to dryland biodiversity, evolving as an outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and a regional conference in Kenya in 1993. It is a subregional consortium that arose from negotiations between the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency/Swedish Agency for Research Cooperation with Developing Countries (Sida/SAREC) and participating institutions from Ethiopia, Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania. In operation since 1997, the Regional Programme has: • promoted and developed the skills of young scientists from the subre gion through the provision of small grants for research relevant to the management of dryland resources; • encouraged capacity-building by developing a tailor-made/demanddriven Master of Science (MSc) curriculum offered via distance learning from Addis Ababa University (Ethiopia); • provided free information exchange and knowledge-sharing on biodiversity-related activities among scientists and managers of natural resources; • reached out to stakeholders and constituencies through networking, information exchange, annual workshops and short courses; and • mobilized and sensitized people at different levels concerning the importance of the sustainable management of dryland biodiversity for development and livelihood support. Case studies from Ethiopia, Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania undertaken in the last six years by the Regional Programme on Sustainable Use of Dryland Biodiversity grantees and MSc students suggest that the solution to combating apathy towards the fate of these drylands and their communities is to develop and adopt sustainable resource-management systems coupled with resource governance in order to capture opportunities for transforming the abundant natural capital of these areas into useful assets.

    "abstract": "Farmers in Afikpo, Ebonyi State, Nigeria, traditionally grow local varieties of rice that are tall, mature at a late stage and have a low yield. To help to improve the yield of this staple crop, the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture has established a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a group of farmers called Bountiful Harvest. Within the framework of the MoU, the university provides the farmers with technical assistance and, with funds provided by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the Federal Ministry of Environment, improved technologies for rice production. A project was designed that involved training, field demonstrations and evaluation of the available choice of technologies by the farmers. The university multiplied and supplied seeds of improved rice varieties and fertilizers, while the farmers decided the dates and times of activities. An initial training workshop focused on techniques for the production of improved rice varieties, soil and water management in rice production, and rice processing. The training emphasized that the farmers would make a larger profit by growing rice varieties with a high yield rather than the unimproved local varieties that are cultivated traditionally. How the water level in rice paddies can be controlled by bunding (the creation of barriers to prevent overflow), making it possible to grow short varieties that have high yields, was also explained to the farmers. Bunding controls the water level within the plots and helps to retain applied fertilizers. The use of improved processing techniques as a means to enhance product quality was also discussed. Subsequent training sessions were planned to precede specific farm operations, such as nursery establishment, transplanting, fertilizer application, weeding, scaring of birds and harvesting. The first year of the project was used for training, field demonstrations, and evaluation of the improved production technology by the farmers. Demonstration sites were located on the farmers’ own farms. Immediately before harvesting, a field day was organized during which farmers compared the two improved varieties with the local variety. On the basis of this assessment, the farmers chose which varieties to grow the following year. In the second year of the project, the farmers were supplied with the rice varieties of their choice as well as fertilizers. University staff visited the farmers at regular intervals during the growing season to offer technical assistance. Most of the farmers in the group have since stopped growing the local varieties, their own experience having shown that the improved varieties give a higher yield than the local variety. The results of the project demonstrated that the life of the rural farmer is linked to his/her sociocultural activities. For example, on “Eke market days”, people do not go to their farms; any farming intervention scheduled in the village on such days is likely to fail as the observance of such days is Extension of Improved Rice Production Technologies to Rural Farmers – Nigeria 213 enforced by local regulations. Such constraints must be recognized and respected if farmers are to show sufficient interest in the technologies being introduced to them.",

    "abstract": "The Faisalabad Area Upgrading Project, which was started in 1994, has proved to be a catalyst for drastic improvement in the urban structure of Faisalabad, a city of 2.5 million inhabitants located in eastern Pakistan. This case study describes the example of Shadab Colony, Faisalabad, where failure of the local authorities to control illegal occupancy and other issues of social cohesion led to the open spaces allocated for recreational parks being used to keep animals and for the dumping of rubbish, resulting in degradation of the environment and problems of health and hygiene. The project was implemented by the Project Management Unit of the Faisalabad Area Upgrading Project (a temporary government unit with social and technical expertise and a focus on health, education and infrastructural development that was created specifically for the project) and by the M. A. Jinnah Development Society (a community-led organization formed as part of the project). The M. A. Jinnah Development Society organized regular contact and street-corner meetings for men and for women to raise awareness of local problems and to suggest practical solutions. As a result, the local people themselves turned the open spaces into parks. Societal pressure forced the local government institutions to listen and take action. While the Faisalabad Area Upgrading Project programmes ended in 2002, the parks created are still green and represent the main recreation areas for the residents of Shadab Colony as well as providing other benefits in terms of health and welfare. The local people have built their capacity to unite and solve local problems. Sustainability is encouraged by a non-governmental organization, the Community Action Programme, which provides technical facilitation on demand, in particular by encouraging links between the community and the government with regard to further development activities. This case study highlights parkdevelopment initiatives in Shadab Colony from a social development perspective, including community mobilization and development at street, neighbourhood and area levels and the tools used to support the formation of multipurpose community organizations. The process of this participatory development was positive for a number of reasons: • the project proved to be a cost-effective way of improving the social, economic and health Development of Open Spaces – Pakistan 225 environment of this slum area; • the development of parks was an opportunity for the local community to see the impact of the development process and its benefits; • the community was mobilized and united to work for this local cause for which a need had already been recognized; and • the process exemplified how an equitable partnership could succeed between communities and government departments.",

This consortium of universities, research institutions and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) was established to address some of the main challenges faced in the Chinyanja Triangle by small farmers ready to move from subsistence to small-scale commercial agriculture and by vulnerable households, including female-headed households and those affected by HIV/AIDS. The consortium was designed to: • recognize and use the strengths and experiences of all partners, including smallholder farmers; • conduct relevant participatoryaction research with smallholder farmers aimed at addressing the challenges of low production, the processing of agricultural products, value addition and access to markets; • cultivate and commercialize indigenous fruits; • improve agricultural production through increased adoption of low-cost technologies, improved farming systems, and crop diversification and intensification; • facilitate access to credit by smallholder farmers by establishing village “revolving funds” and providing access to other microfinance schemes; • facilitate linkages between the private sector and smallholder farmers; • create a pool of experts, build capacity and transfer skills at all levels; and • maximize impact through the mobilization of material, human and financial resources from partner organizations and others. The three main areas of intervention were: • the introduction and dissemination of low-cost/low-labour irrigation technologies; • scaling up the dissemination of low-input agricultural practices such as improved fallows and increased access to fuel wood; and • scaling up dissemination of valueadded processing technologies, especially for cassava and sweet potato.",

    "abstract": "The Indigenous Knowledge and Peoples Network for Capacity Building in Mainland Montane South-East Asia (IKAP) was formed in 2002 by a group of indigenous peoples, development workers and researchers with the aim of promoting biocultural diversity by revaluing indigenous knowledge in mainland montane Southeast Asia. From the beginning, the focus of IKAP has been on the creation of training opportunities for indigenous specialists, facilitators, researchers and committed development workers in order to support indigenous knowledge in local communities. The Network coordination team facilitates communication, exchange and learning between its members in six countries – Cambodia, China, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam – who are engaged with the right of indigenous communities to determine their development in a sustainable, healthy and prosperous way. The networks of practitioners of indigenous knowledge (e.g., farmers, healers, midwives, seed-keepers, artisans, musicians, village educators) from ethnic minorities living in villages of the Mekong region are linked through an approach called “affirmation of cultures and biodiversity conservation” (ACBC). This approach is innovative since it promotes the recovery of indigenous knowledge (e.g., language and identity) and strengthening of the indigenous community as a means to achieve sustainable development (or an alternative to mainstream development). It is in contrast to the prevailing mindset in which indigenous knowledge, languages and cultures are marginalized, neglected or even repressed as being “second-class” knowledge, superstition or primitive, following ethnocentric values and theories. Capacity-building among indigenous communities requires support at three levels: • development of human resources: working with skilled facilitators and trainers to promote indigenous cultures and management of resources, reinforcing local knowledge and wisdom; • organizational strengthening: changing the agenda of development and research projects towards the respect and affirmation of cultures and the conservation of biodiversity; and • institution-building: creation of local institutions and regional support structures that enable indigenous “knowers” (elders, intellectuals) to transmit their wisdom to younger generations. Indigenous Community Networks – Southeast Asia 255 The body of concepts, methods and ethical guidelines used by IKAP is designed to orient the training of facilitators and trainers towards institutional change and the self-determination of ethnic communities and minorities to recreate their cultures and livelihoods while protecting biodiversity and the environment.",

    "abstract": "This generic project is being implemented in several coastal villages of the State of Tamil Nadu in South India. The project villages are inhabited by people known as Dalits (untouchables), who have traditionally been at the bottom of the social and economic hierarchy. The target group consists of women and children in socially disadvantaged and economically deprived communities in these villages. The project is part of a larger ongoing Eco-villages Project being implemented by IOI-India since 1997 in more than 60 of these villages. The focus of the Eco-villages Project was initially on women since they are under greater pressure compared to other members of the community. They must take care of the family, raise the children and collect water and firewood in addition to working outside the home. In recent years, the Eco-villages Project has taken up activities for children and the project described in this case study is an example of such an initiative. 15 IOI Operational Centre Involved:  IOI-India, located at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India Project Coordinators:  R. Rajagopalan, S. P. Subramanian and Shanti Devapiriam The children in these communities face problems such as poor quality of education combined with discriminatory treatment in schools; lack of help from parents in doing schoolwork; lack of opportunities for further education, training and expression of talent; malnutrition; and lack of proper medical facilities or other amenities in the villages. The project helps the children by setting up a Junior Centre in each village, providing supplementary education and other opportunities. Each Centre requires a budget of $15,000 spread over three years. The project is an innovative attempt to make each Centre sustainable. A part of the funds (about $2,000) is used to extend microcredit to the women’s groups in the target village. Over three years, a corpus fund is created in the village from the service charges collected each month from the recipients of microcredit. At the end of the third year, the capital being circulated in the village is also added to the corpus fund. From the beginning of the fourth year, the Centre is run entirely by the women’s group, using the interest from the corpus fund. IOI-India implements the project with the support of a local NGO, Anawim Trust. This model of linking microcredit with the running of children’s centres has been replicated in 11 villages and is being extended to more. The number of children benefiting from the programme in a village ranges from 30 to 70, depending on the size of the village and its population pattern.",

The project implemented an intensive educational and training programme to upgrade skills and raise awareness in the fishing sector and other similar jobs in order to increase the women’s income and improve their livelihoods. In Egypt, most of the fishing communities are concentrated in the area of the northern lakes so the programme was focused on these communities. During the first phase (April-July 2006), training was conducted in El-Teloul village (Bardawil lagoon), Northern Sinai Governorate. The second phase of training (July-October 2007) was conducted in Borg El-Brollus village (Brollus Lake), Kaferelshaikh Governorate.

In Egypt, there is a general lack of information concerning the extent of the economic participation of women in the small-scale fisheries sector nationwide. The project focused particular attention on the activities of the artisanal fisheries sector. Women in these small fishing communities were trained in the cleaning, sorting, processing and packing of fish. The objective was to increase the job opportunities and income-generating activities for women who are disadvantaged. The project also emphasized the participation of women in the economy and encouraged the recognition of their unrewarded efforts in the management of these communities. It was also able to help the women to apply for small loans from banks for initiating small projects. The project received $15,000 over two years (2006-2007) from IOI-Egypt.",

    "abstract": "The project was located in the Sevastopol region of Ukraine. The official population of the Sevastopol community was 346,000, approximately 70 per cent of whom were women while 20 per cent were youth and children (5-19 years of age). The majority of the population was made up of senior citizens, causing an overload on the local economy. The coastal zone of Ukraine, which is approximately 1,000 km long, was a depressed region with a shrinking population and dramatically declining environments. Old means of gaining incomes (huge and profitable navy bases, ecologically harmful and retrograde shipbuilding, “Kremlin tourism”, etc.) were no longer valid as survival strategies. Millions of coastal-zone inhabitants in Ukraine were rapidly running out of land and energy resources. The quality of the environment was declining and people’s health was failing. 37 IOI Operational Centre Involved:  IOI-Ukraine, located at the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas, Sevastopol, Ukraine Project Coordinator:  Victoria Radchenko Thus, it was necessary to increase public awareness of emerging environmental issues in the marine and coastal zone of the country. There also was a need to involve a wide range of coastal inhabitants in activities aimed at environmental protection and sustainable use of the natural resources. These were key ideas behind of the project, “Empowering Women and Youth in the Sustainable Development of a Coastal Community”. The main project objectives were to: • increase public awareness of emerging environmental issues; • empower the women and youth to help to achieve sustainable development of the coastal community; and • promote the development of ecotourism in the region by increasing the awareness of environmental issues on the part of women employed in tourism. In order to have good publicity and to attract additional funding, IOI-Ukraine cooperated with several partners in the project, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government departments, scientific and educational institutions, and business units.

    "abstract": "IOI-Western Africa carried out a project on improved fish processing and loss reduction in four Nigerian coastal communities in 2004 and 2005. All four communities were located in the Ibeju-Lekki Local Government Area of Lagos State on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. While the focal community was Orimedu, the three other communities are in contiguous areas. The major objectives of the project included reduction of post-harvest loss, especially during the glut season, and the introduction of more efficient smoking kilns. The project started with a diagnostic socio-economic survey to identify the major socio-economic problems of the communities and the best ways in which the IOI could intervene. The main project activities included awareness-raising programmes for women, training the women in the operations of the kilns, and the construction and donation of contemporary kilns to the communities. 51 IOI Operational Centre Involved:  IOI-Western Africa, located at the Nigerian Institute for Oceanography and Marine Research (NIOMR), Victoria Island, Lagos, Nigeria Project Coordinator:  E. O. Oyewo In the course of this project, IOIWestern Africa cooperated with other bodies and agencies. The project benefited immensely from an existing relationship between the Nigerian Institute for Oceanography and Marine Research (NIOMR); the African Regional Center for Technology (ARCT) based in Dakar, Senegal; and the International Development and Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada. The smoking kiln adopted by the IOI for this project is the one developed under an NIOMR/ARCT/IDRC partnership. A useful relationship has also been established with the Centre de recherches halieutiques et océanologiques du Bénin, arising from the project and in connection with its extension to the Aido-Plage community in Benin. The IOI-Western Africa contact person and two other volunteers from this Centre facilitated and participated in the initial familiarization trips to the Aido-Plage Ouida community. In conjunction with partners in the project, the benefiting communities were informed about the availability of options to traditional curing methods and trained in the use of contemporary kilns while such kilns were donated to the benefiting communities. The introduction of these kilns was an exercise in community development. In the process, some women were empowered while food security through reduction in postharvest loss, improved income and better nutrition were promoted. One of the conclusions after the 2004 exercise was that the project should be replicated in as many other communities as possible. Accordingly, project activities are being replicated in another Nigerian community, Akodo, as well as in AidoPlage Ouida, a coastal community in Benin. For monitoring and evaluation, two principal participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools were employed: observations and semi-structured interviews during interactive sessions. Because of the pervasive question of dwindling near-shore resources, future plans for the benefiting communities include the promotion of aquaculture as an enterprise and an alternative vocation during the lull in the fishing season. Other activities based on the philosophy of the Women, Youth and the Sea Programme will still be carried out in these communities depending on the availability of resources. Furthermore, the synergy between the IOI-Western Africa Open Day for women processors and the project will be exploited to full advantage. The project cost for the four coastal communities was about $8,400.",

The island has a population of about 800, 56 per cent of whom are men and 44 per cent are women. The community had been dependent on fisheries, but the marine species were being depleted owing to overexploitation and marine pollution. The Venado Island Integrated Development Project (Programa de Desarrollo Integral de la Isla Venado) of Universidad Nacional (UNA) targeted the entire community of the island, with all the inhabitants being beneficiaries. Its broad objectives were to: • improve the quality of life of the community of Venado Island by strengthening its cultural values and skills, thereby enabling the people to manage their natural resources in a sustainable manner; 73 IOI Operational Centre Involved:  IOI-Costa Rica,  located at Universidad Nacional, Costa Rica Project Coordinator:  Rose Marie Ruiz Bravo Overall Project Supervisor:  Alejandro Guttierez • find alternative sources of employment (other than artisanal fishing) for the people; • provide scientific and technological tools to the community for carrying out infrastructure and socio-productive activities; and • promote local autonomy and inclusive and equitable democracy. The project started in 2000 and was slated to end in 2008, with a possible extension. The total budget was $226,500, of which IOI-Costa Rica contributed $72,000 while the rest came from UNA. In addition, the resources generated and managed by the nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) involved in the project amounted to about $100,000. The contributions made by the community and the State were constant and important but difficult to quantify. Between 2000 and 2007, a number of sub-projects were implemented in the areas of community infrastructure, alternative employment, human development, education, the arts, recreation, community health and environmental management. Apart from improving the economic status of the people, the activities have led to the emergence of younger community leaders and greater participation of the people in development issues.",

The people of Vanuaso Tikina (“tikina” means “district”), like those on the rest of Gau Island, are involved in commercial agriculture and intensive fishing. The activities of the community have been altering the coastal habitats such as mangrove forests and seagrass beds. In addition, changes in the villages such as population growth and the adoption of westernized lifestyles have resulted in coastal pollution and more exploitative uses of natural resources, thus threatening the people’s living conditions. The aim of the project is to involve the people in sustainable development, initially in five of the villages in the district and ultimately in all of the 16 villages on Gau Island. The initiative also seeks to make Gau Island a place where the people use natural resources based on appropriate management plans developed for their villages and the island. 85 IOI Operational Centre Involved:  IOI-Pacific Islands, located at the School of Marine Studies, University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji Project Coordinators:  Joeli Veitayaki and Takeshi Murai The project engages local communities in the management of their environmental resources. It empowers the villagers to make plans and take decisions that incorporate their social and economic aspirations and requirements and yet are holistic and consistent with known sustainable development practices. The local communities are assisted in adopting integrated resource management that enhances community livelihoods and promotes sustainable development practices in the use of their natural resources and associated land-use practices. The project is an evolving collaborative effort that began in 2002. It involves the University of the South Pacific, IOI-Pacific Islands, and their partners, working with the people of Gau, who are represented by the Committee Lomani Gau, formed by the concerned villages in 2005. The project enjoys the support of the chiefs of the three districts, all the villages, the provincial administration and the Ministry of Health. The input of funds into the project has been about $10,000 per year, raised from different sources, including IOI-Pacific Islands. The project has encouraged the people in the individual villages to formulate resource management plans and use them as part of their development practices. The expected outputs of the project include the use and adoption of proper land-use guidelines, better-managed coastal habitats, protected water catchments to avoid contamination of drinking water, well-managed disposal of waste, healthy water and safer drainage in villages, rehabilitated coastal vegetation, a participatory way of taking decisions, an integrated resource-management approach, use of appropriate and safe development technology, and adoption of new sources of livelihood and income.",

    "abstract": "The project is located on Gazi Bay, Msambweni District, on the south coast of Kenya. On the landward side, Gazi Bay is bordered by 615 ha of mangrove forests. As in many sites along the Kenyan coast, mangrove deforestation has been widespread in Gazi. The loss of mangroves has affected the local economy as indicated by shortages of building poles and firewood, decreased fishery resources and increased coastal erosion. The main thrust of the current project is to conserve mangroves and thereby provide tangible benefits to the village communities engaged in the conservation. Project activities include mangrove reforestation, ecotourism activities, beekeeping and integrated aquaculture. To date, 100 ha of degraded mangrove areas in Gazi have been reforested with suitable species. A mangrove boardwalk about 350 metres long, together with fishponds for milkfish farming, has also been constructed for ecotourism. 97 IOI Operational Centre Involved:  IOI-Eastern Africa, located at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, Mombasa, Kenya Project Coordinator:  James G. Kairo This is a multi-phase conservation and development project on mangrove forests.  The current phase will last for five years, beginning from 2005. The project proponents are the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute and IOIEastern Africa in partnership with the Gazi community. Initial funding for the current phase of the project was received from the City Council of Overijse, Belgium ($15,000); the IOI Women, Youth and the Sea Programme ($15,000); the Western Indian Ocean Marine Association ($6,000); and the WWF-Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund ($5,000).",

    "abstract": "Samoa, located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, comprises two main islands and several smaller ones, making up a landmass of just over 2,400 sq km. The population of 172,000 consists mostly of subsistence fisherfolk and farmers, who live in villages with strong traditional customs. Many factors have caused a decline in natural resources and degradation of the environment over the years, resulting in a serious crisis threatening the livelihoods of the people. The Government of Samoa sought assistance from partners to meet this challenge and an innovative project was born. The thrust of the project, implemented between 1995 and 2000, was to arrest the degradation of marine resources by encouraging communities to develop management plans and empowering them to implement and enforce them. 109 IOI Operational Centres Involved: IOI-Australia, located at James Cook University, Townsville, Australia, and IOI-Pacific Islands, located at the University of the South Pacific, Suva, Fiji Project Coordinators:  Posa A. Skelton and G. Robin South The Government of Australia, under its Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) Program, assisted the Government of Samoa to implement the Village Fisheries Management Programme. Under this Programme, the Government set up an Extension Unit (or Community Outreach Section) in the Fisheries Division in 1995 for training newly recruited officers in culturally appropriate ways in order to enable them to work in villages. The Extension Unit worked successfully with over 80 coastal villages in developing their own management plans, including undertaking a range of activities such as establishing conservation areas. The Programme recognized that to adequately manage the coastal environment and resources, the users must be part of the equation. The Village Level Coral Reef Monitoring Project was initiated in 1998 to complement the Village Fisheries Management Programme. The partners in this project were the IOI-Pacific Islands, the Marine Studies Programme at the University of the South Pacific, the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, and the Government of Samoa. The funding came from the Government of the United States of America. The objective of the project was to train Government officers in scientific coral-reef monitoring methodology so that they could then train villagers to monitor their marine resources. The training manual was adapted for local needs and translated into the Samoan language, with the ultimate aim of training the villagers to do their own monitoring. The training of trainers was undertaken at the Fisheries Division in Apia in 1998. By the end of the project, over 80 village communities had been empowered to manage their natural resources. Several community-derived solutions had been implemented, such as establishing protected areas in traditional fishing grounds, restocking reefs with overharvested species and exploring alternative livelihoods.",

There are two types of communities in the area: the local inhabitants, who reside there full time, and a transient community, comprising the national and international tourists visiting the area every summer to enjoy the beach. The project will seek to solve some of the community problems. The main objective is the conservation and recovery of nature and human values for the benefit of future generations. Combined efforts based on community participatory techniques are aimed at reviving the cultural, patrimonial and environmental values of the area. The main goal is to sensitize children and younger people to aspects relating to plastic arts since this area was the home of Amelia Peláez, the most noted Cuban painter of the twentieth century. Activities are based mainly on continuous contact with natural ecosystems (marine and land) at this location, which will help people to understand the importance of conservation. 119 IOI Operational Centre Involved: IOI-Cuba, located at the Center for Marine Research, University of Havana, Havana, Cuba Project Coordinator:  Silvia Patricia González Díaz The partners in the project are the Center for Marine Research, University of Havana; the Institute of Oceanography; the Institute of Tropical Medicine; Pro Naturaleza, an NGO; and the Work Group of Havana Harbour.

It began as a community-based Gracilaria farm, which started in 1995 as a Master of Science degree (botany) project at the University of the Western Cape. In 1997, IOI-Southern Africa presented a 10-day course, Seaweed Mariculture for Community Development, to the members of the historically disadvantaged community in Saint Helena Bay. The course led to an interest group, the Community Seaweed Initiative, whose members started a Gracilaria farm in Saint Helena Bay. Initial funding was obtained from the Department of Trade and Industry and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ). In conjunction with the community group, IOI-Southern Africa applied for and was granted a seawater lease in Saint Helena Bay and developed a business plan, funding proposals and training programmes. 139 IOI Operational Centre Involved: IOI-Southern Africa, located at the University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa Project Coordinators:  Jocelyn Collins and Peter Jordaan The key partners in the project were the community of Saint Helena, the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (Marine and Coastal Management branch), the Department of Trade and Industry, GTZ, the University of Stellenbosch, the University of the Western Cape, and IOI-Southern Africa. The achievements included the following: • Maribus Industries (Pty) Ltd., a community-owned company, was established and registered. Currently, it has 18 shareholders of whom 17 are previously disadvantaged individuals. (The term “previously disadvantaged individual” refers to a person who was discriminated against during the apartheid regime.) Women account for 67 per cent of the leadership. • A 15-year seawater lease was granted to Maribus Industries (Pty) Ltd. • Scientific research was completed. • Shareholders visited a working Gracilaria farm in Lüderitz, Namibia, in December 2002. • Preliminary international market research was done and a potential international seaweed buyer was identified. • A kelp concession was granted and the company began collecting and selling kelp chips. • A workshop was held on raft-building.

    "abstract": "The Department of Fisheries, Thailand, began implementing the Village Fishpond Development Project and the School Fishpond Development Project in rural areas of Thailand in 1978. It had a yearly budget of more than $20 million for the projects though the funds declined from 2000 onwards. The activities included the construction of fishponds, production of fingerlings and feed, training and operations. There were thousands of fishponds ranging from 0.2 ha to 20 ha in all rural areas of the country that could be used to produce fish for human consumption. However, fish production in community fishponds was relatively low, with 3-5 kg/ha/year. In 2000, IOI-Thailand initiated a learning concept for effective delivery of both projects. The objective was to enhance people’s learning and participation in the planning as well as use of water resources in integrated aquaculture and agriculture to improve the benefits of community livelihoods. 147 IOI Operational Centre Involved:  IOI-Thailand, located in the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, Bangkok,  Thailand Project Coordinator:  Cherdsak Virapat The school was taken as the core institution at the grass-roots level that would strengthen community participation. Children were engaged in learning about fishpond preparation, fish stocking, the production of fish feed, fish harvesting and eating fish for the school lunch. The school children also participated in household data collection. Communities participated in fishpond management and consultation with fisheries experts, resulting in an increase in fish production. Women’s groups developed under the Village Fishpond Development Project showed a significant contribution regarding community fish culture and simple post-harvest technologies for generating local income and employment. Local government officers participated in the co-management process. The initiatives were carried out in selected areas throughout the country and it is recommended that the Department of Fisheries continue to implement the projects throughout Thailand. The model can be adapted and implemented in other developing countries in the region such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam as well as in developing countries in Africa.",

Using simple visual maps and technical information revolving around the village, school children and their communities were able to participate in planning and organizing with two objectives in mind: to increase their capacity to learn from past disasters for better future protection and to improve measures for the reduction of disaster risk. The target group for training included students, school administrators, teachers, village leaders, local administrative organizations and provincial government officers from various departments. The training activities were undertaken by the National Disaster Warning Center team, including specialists in rural development, community disaster management and extension, and civil engineering, facilitated by a specialist in non-formal education. The National Disaster Warning Center, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation, the Office of the Commission for Basic Education, the Ministry of Education and the Department of Fisheries collaborated during the development of the plans for learning and disaster preparedness and disaster response, including ways to mitigate impact.

The purpose of the project was to empower the coastal fishing communities in the developing countries and to formulate a model for sustainable management of the marine resources. There was a strong need on the part of Rayang and Tarcoles to empower the coastal fishing communities, stabilize livelihoods, encourage community-based activities and introduce sustainable fishery. There also was a strong desire on the part of Himi to develop international contacts and transfer its fishing technology. Himi had been facing a decline in population (particularly in the fishery 175 IOI Operational Centres Involved:  IOI-Japan, located at Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan, and IOI-Costa Rica, located at Universidad Nacional (UNA), Costa Rica Project Coordinators:  Tsutomu Fuse, Masako Bannai Otsuka and  Alejandro Gutierrez sector), migration of youth to larger cities and a high percentage of elderly people. The society in Himi needed a breakthrough to give the citizens confidence. Introducing set-net fishing gear – an environmentally friendly technology that the citizens could be proud of – to foreign fishermen was a suitable means of reevaluating their traditional wisdom in the contemporary context. The project was planned and implemented by IOI-Japan, IOI-Costa Rica, Himi citizens, Tarcoles villagers, the Instituto Costarricense de Pesca y Acuicultura (INCOPESCA), a national fishery cooperative in Costa Rica, and the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC). The first phase of the project started in 2000 and evolved into the second and third phases. The project was waiting for the fourth phase at the time of writing of the case study.

    "abstract": "The Republic of South Africa has a population of 48 million people living in nine provinces. Since the abolition of apartheid in the mid-1990s, the Government’s objective has been to provide equal services to all citizens. To achieve this will require significant infrastructure redevelopment in a number of sectors, one of which is healthcare. More than half of all the country’s medical facilities suffer from lack of maintenance, many requiring substantial restructuring in order to serve the needs of the entire population. The situation has been exacerbated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic that has been experienced in South Africa. While this challenge is nationwide, an example at the provincial level best illustrates the positive approach being taken by the Government of South Africa. The Province of Free State (fig. 1) is in central South Africa, with the provincial capital at Bloemfontein. About 2.8 million people reside in Free State. Of this population, only 13 per cent have private health insurance and most rely on government-operated facilities for their healthcare needs. There are two academic public hospitals in Bloemfontein: Pelonomi and Universitas. To reduce redundant services, improve cost-effectiveness and provide the same level of medical care for all South Africans, the Free State Health Department (FSHD) decided to combine and coordinate the operations of the two hospitals. 13 A 1997 Health Facilities audit for the Free State showed that an estimated 825 million rand (R) were needed to address infrastructure backlog in the health sector, with almost R100 million needed for Pelonomi Hospital alone. There simply was not enough funding in the budget to cover these expenses. In 1998, FSHD began exploring many possible solutions. Realizing that the hospitals already outsourced their catering, gardening, cleaning and security services, they concluded that they could also lease out the extra space in each hospital. By leasing the extra space to a private company, FSHD could generate capital to help offset the cost of hospital operation while the private company would gain space for private healthcare services at a lower cost because of not needing to build new facilities. In November 2002, an agreement was reached by FSHD and a consortium of two healthcare companies. Under this agreement, the private hospital beds and operating theatres were co-located within the two public hospital facilities and the private partner funded all of the renovations to both of the FSHD hospitals. After eliminating the duplication of services, there was available space in the two hospitals equivalent to 500 beds. In addition, operating-room access and other specialized facilities could be shared on a fee basis. Now Bloemfontein (fig. 2) offers all its citizens better healthcare choices. For insured citizens, new facilities are available to them. For the uninsured, Pelonomi and Universitas Hospitals offer excellent care in well-maintained and up-to-date facilities. For the partially insured, this public-private partnership (PPP) offers them their choice in services.",

    "abstract": "The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has undertaken a major effort to combat malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. One major focus of their programmes has been the distribution of insecticide-treated nets, with much of this effort funded by international health organizations and philanthropy. This programme in Mali offers an example of expansion of the programme through the use of a public-private partnership (PPP). Mali is a landlocked country (fig. 1) with a mostly flat terrain and some rocky hills in the north. The Niger River crosses the southern part of the country and forms an interior delta. Mali also has a subtropical to arid climate. Those parts of the country that receive significant rainfall experience a rainy season for part of the year and extremely dry weather for the remainder of the year. During the rainy season, Mali often faces problems with flooding when the Niger River overflows. When combined with environmental problems of deforestation, soil erosion and desertification, this creates conditions ideal for the transmission of malaria. Malaria is one of the principal causes of mortality and morbidity in Mali. With a population of approximately 11 million, Mali has over 800,000 reported cases of malaria annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Malaria 21 accounts for 13 per cent of all mortality for children under the age of five. It is endemic throughout the more populated southern half of the country, with over 90 per cent of the total population at risk of endemic malaria, with young children and pregnant women being the most vulnerable. Malaria spreads through the bite of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, infected with the Plasmodium parasite. The mosquito receives the parasite from a blood meal taken on an infected person. When the mosquito takes a blood meal from another person, these parasites are injected through the mosquito’s bite. Once the parasite enters a person’s blood, toxins are eventually released that cause fever, chills and flu-like malaria symptoms. If the person is left untreated at this stage, malaria can quickly become life-threatening by disrupting the blood supply to vital organs. An estimated 80 to 90 per cent of children under five years of age carry Plasmodium parasites during the rainy season in Mali. Malaria is a fatal disease that can be prevented and cured. The best method of prevention is insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), which are also one of the most cost-effective interventions against malaria. An ITN is a mosquito net that repels, disables and kills mosquitoes coming into contact with the insecticide on the netting material. Mosquito nets treated with Pyrethroid insecticides add a chemical barrier to the net’s physical one, killing mosquitoes that come into contact with it. If used properly, the ITNs offer at least a 50 per cent reduction in the risk of contracting malaria. The challenge for Mali was to find an economic and efficient way to distribute these ITNs to the broadest portion of the population possible. NetMark is a project to accomplish this very objective by building commercial markets for ITNs. The project was launched by the Government of Mali in the early 1990s, with the intent of harnessing the power of the commercial sector to reach citizens effectively and equitably and leveraging the impact of limited public-sector resources. NetMark formed a public-private partnership Figure 1 Mali, a landlocked country. Figure 2 The Anopheles gambiae mosquito. Malaria Control, Mali 23 (PPP) with the National Malaria Control Programme of Mali, using a time-limited investment by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to increase the commercial supply of and public demand for ITNs.

    "abstract": "In July 1997, the Government of Gabon signed a 20-year concession contract with a private French consortium to operate water and electricity services throughout the country. The contract endeavoured to expand water and electrical service to unconnected areas. This contract was executed following institutional reform of the water and electricity sectors. The public entity, Societe d’énergie et d’eau du Gabon (SEEG), provides both water and electricity services in partnership with the private concessionaire, each holding a 49 per cent and 51 per cent share, respectively. The venture has been successful, often exceeding targets in existing service areas; however, less progress has been made in more isolated areas of the country, where the population is extremely dispersed. This performance-driven contract defines quality requirements and coverage targets as the main drivers of private investment and has proven extremely successful. A unique feature of the project is a cross-subsidy provision by which electricity revenues are used to fund investment in the water sector. The multiutility service provision has brought several benefits to Gabon by enabling cost reductions through the sharing of resources, particularly evident at the headquarters and regional levels. It has also enabled the creation of an integrated investment planning and coordination platform with important stakeholders and 33 placed SEEG in a stronger position to negotiate prices in the local markets, enabling it to reduce contracting costs by about 30 per cent. Strong Government commitment, consistent improvements in service quality and reduced tariffs have been largely responsible for the success of the partnership. The clear understanding between the public and private partners has allowed both to meet their objectives. The private sector has been gradually expanding services in small towns and rural areas and the Government has paid its bills consistently after some irregularity during the first two years of the contract.",

    "abstract": "The Republic of Guatemala, nestled between Mexico, Belize, Honduras and El Salvador, has a population of about 13 million, 60 per cent of whom live in rural communities. During the latter part of the twentieth century, the country’s economic progress was limited by a civil war that consumed the majority of the Government’s resources – both political and economic. With the Peace Accord and the creation of a new Constitution in 1996, there was a call for more investment in power, water and transportation infrastructure to address some of the social and economic divisions. Leaders across the political spectrum recognized the need for improved infrastructure and basic services in the country, especially for rural communities with mostly indigenous populations. Since that time, the Government has worked to improve infrastructure and has involved the private sector in several areas to help with the much-needed investment. In 1998, only 60 per cent of Guatemalan households had an electricity connection. In rural areas, the percentage was even lower; at 52 per cent, it was one of the lowest connection percentages in Central America.  Up to that time, the Government’s National Institute of Electrification (INDE) was a vertically integrated utility that controlled the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Guatemala. Under INDE, the distribution system was run by three companies: Electricity 41 Distribution of the East (DEORSA) and Electricity Distribution of the West (DEOCSA), both of which served rural communities, and the Electric Company of Guatemala S.A. (EEGSA), which served the metropolitan area around Guatemala City. The distribution system suffered from a lack of maintenance, both preventive and corrective. Simultaneously, the quality of service was also decreasing owing both to poor maintenance and increasing demands on the system caused by the increased use of electricity. To modernize the electricity sector in Guatemala and expand service to more rural communities, the Government, through INDE, created the Rural Electrification Plan (PER). The PER called for the break up of INDE and the involvement of private companies in the expansion of service to rural communities. The aim of the plan was to expand service to over 280,000 new rural connections (in 2,633 communities) within five years, amounting to an increase to over 1.5 million people served. Upon successful completion of this effort, electricity was made available to 90 per cent of the population as a whole and to 75 per cent of the population in rural areas. To undertake this new plan, INDE retained control of generation and transmission and decided to include the private sector in the distribution of electricity. In 1998, the Government requested bids for DEOCSA and DEORSA and entered into a public-private partnership (PPP). INDE retained ownership of the assets and the private company was contracted to expand, operate and maintain the distribution system in rural areas (fig. 1). The same private company (hereafter referred to as DISCOS) was awarded the contracts for both distribution systems. Under the PER, the focus was on communities and households rather than on distance from the existing grid. For each connection completed and verified by third-party supervisors, DISCOS was paid a fixed amount. DISCOS earned additional revenue from the sale of electricity, per the approved tariffs. Between 1999 and 2001, DISCOS connected over 300,000 customers, consisting of 130,000 PER connections and 195,000 non-PER connections. As of 2007, DISCOS supplied electricity to over 1.29 million customers, the majority of which were residential. From 1998 to 2007, DISCOS added over 650,000 customers, meeting the goal of 280,000 new rural connections. Figure 1 Rural Guatemala. Rural Electrification, Guatemala 43",

    "abstract": "Since the early 1990s, the Government of Morocco has sought to provide electricity to all of its citizens. The national grid is centralized, which makes it difficult and expensive to connect rural households to the system. This circumstance has led the Government to pursue alternative methods of electrical service delivery, particularly for rural areas. This case study describes Morocco’s use of a public-private partnership (PPP) to achieve its rural electrification objectives. The Office national de l’électricité (ONE) is the State-run operator in the electricity supply sector and the Government entity that oversees the rural electrification project. In June 2002, ONE entered into a PPP with a private company to electrify rural households by using solar energy to produce electricity. The technology selected presents various social, economic and environmental benefits while encouraging the rural population to remain on their land rather than move to the small towns or large cities that are connected to the grid. The private operator is responsible for the installation and maintenance of solar equipment as well as the collection of users’ fees in 24 of Morocco’s 62 prefectures and provinces. However, the solar customers actually become clients of ONE once they sign the utility contract. 49 In order to ensure the viability and sustainability of the project, the Government and the operator agreed to a fee-for-service business model. The customers pay an initial connection fee and a monthly service fee determined by the type of service that they receive. ONE provides an equipment subsidy that enables the partnership to offer electrical service at affordable rates by offsetting the high installation and maintenance costs associated with solar home systems (fig. 1). Owing to this subsidy, the partnership is able to offer rural customers comparable rates to what Moroccan households that are connected to the grid pay for service. Customers are able to pay their bills at local offices of the private operator or to its representatives who attend the weekly markets in the provinces. While rural households have other alternatives for electrification, the private operator’s accessibility to the rural population and dedication to customer support have helped to increase the number of solar clients in Morocco.",

    "abstract": "Manila, the capital of the Philippines, has the eighteenth largest metropolitan area in the world, which includes 15 cities and 2 municipalities. Mandaluyong City (fig. 1) is the smallest city of the cities in Metro Manila, with an area of only 12 square kilometres and a population of over 278,000 people. A public market was located in the heart of Mandaluyong City on a 7,500 square metre area along Kalentong Road, a main transit route. In 1991, the market was destroyed in a major fire in large part because most of the structure was made of wood. As a temporary answer for the displaced vendors, the government allowed about 500 of them to set up stalls along the area’s roads and sidewalks. This rapidly proved to be impractical in that it led to both traffic congestion and sanitation problems. Rebuilding the public market became a high priority for the city government, but financing a project with an estimated cost of 50 million Public Market, Mandaluyong City, Philippines 6 59 Figure 1 Map of Mandaluyong City. pesos was beyond the city’s capability. Local interest rates were high, averaging approximately 18 per cent annually and the city was not prepared to take on the additional debt that construction of a new market would have required. The city government was also concerned that if the charges to stall owners became too onerous, the increased costs would have to be passed on to their customers, many of whom were lower-income residents of the area. The answer to this problem that the city government decided to use was based on the Philippines’ national BuildOperate-Transfer Law (BOT) of 1991. This provided the statutory basis for developing a public-private partnership (PPP) for the project. A business consortium was created, called Macro Funders and Developers, Inc. (MFD), to complete the project. A seven-story commercial centre, named The Marketplace (fig. 2), was designed to include a public market, street-front stores, a parking garage, commercial shops, department stores, a bowling alley and a movie theatre. Through this partnership, the commercial activity conducted in the new structure generates incomes that are used to recoup the capital investment by the private sector. The economic impact of this project was significant. The construction of The Marketplace led to a near-term doubling of the property value and to a significant increase in city revenue from business and entertainment taxes (an additional $10 million pesos to $20 pesos million per year). Hundreds of new jobs were created to operate The Marketplace’s many new businesses. With the vendors relocated into this modern facility, traffic congestion was reduced on area streets and sanitation problems were eliminated. By using a PPP, the Mandaluyong City government gained a modern public market at a much lower cost to the city, making the project possible when it had not been before.",

Led by concerned parents and the 21st Century School Fund, a District of Columbia-based non-profit, the local community began searching for alternative financing sources for improving the school facility. This culminated in the formation of a publicprivate partnership (PPP) between the District of Columbia Public School District, the District of Columbia municipal government and a national real estate development company. The partnership developed a unique solution and the school was not just kept open and renovated but is now housed in a completely new, state-of-the-art building, all at no cost to the taxpayers (fig. 1).

    "abstract": "At the time of its opening on 27 October 1907, Union Station was the largest train station in the world and a truly monumental example of Beaux-Arts architecture (fig. 1). By the late 1970s, however, the building was in a serious state of disrepair, unoccupied and in danger of demolition. The Federal Government lacked funds to renovate or even maintain the station. Citizen groups and politicians began searching for an alternative approach. As a result, the United States Congress enacted the Redevelopment Act of 1981. Under this Act, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) took control of the project and began to transform the station into a thriving transportation terminal and commercial centre. Because of the costs involved in the restoration and the potential commercial economic benefits, a public-private partnership (PPP) was immediately identified as the best tool to accomplish the restoration. The transformation process included the efforts of the DOT, the District of Columbia municipal government, Amtrak (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, a quasi-governmental entity) and a private developer. The $160 million project took almost five years to complete, including three years of 69 renovation. The project goals encompassed the authentic restoration of the original architecture, the reintroduction of train and urban mass transit services, and the addition of a wide range of retail, dining and entertainment options. As a result of a PPP, Union Station has been restored to its original grandeur and utility and is now the most visited site in the city, with over 25 million visitors each year.",

    "abstract": "The Rio de la Plata estuary (fig. 1) is nestled between Argentina, Uruguay and the Atlantic Ocean. It serves as the waterway access to Buenos Aires as well as for the Uruguay and Paraná Rivers, the Paraná Interior and the upstream Argentine grain ports of Rosario and Santa Fé. Within the Rio de la Plata estuary, the average depth is between one and six metres except in the two channels:  the artificial Mitre Channel, parallel to the Argentine coast, and the natural Martin Garcia Channel, parallel to the Uruguayan coast. The Martin Garcia Channel is 106 kilometres long, beginning near the city of Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, and ending at the Uruguay River, near Nueva Palmira, Uruguay. Both channels have been sporadically dredged to various depths ever since the Martin Garcia Channel was first opened in 1892. Dredging of the waterways throughout the river basin has been an integral part of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) plan, the trade agreement between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay signed in 1991. The objective was to make the transportation of goods more efficient and thereby improve the economy of the region. Increased shipping in the region and the need for a more efficient way to move bulk goods, requiring larger vessels, added strain to the existing channels. The Martin Garcia Channel, while more direct and a little 75 deeper than the Mitre Channel, was not deep enough to handle the larger vessels that many shipping companies had begun to use nor wide enough to accommodate multiple vessels concurrently. As a result, portions of the channel were limited to one-way traffic, causing significant wait times during periods of high traffic. To address this problem and other concerns, a bi-national organization between Argentina and Uruguay known as the Rio de la Plata Administrator Commission (CARP) was created in the 1970s to oversee interactions involving the river. It accordingly commissioned a number of feasibility studies in the mid1990s for the dredging of the Martin Garcia Channel. CARP wanted to dredge the shallow portions of the Channel to grant larger vessels access to the naturally deep Paraná River. A design-build operate-transfer public-private partnership (PPP) was devised for this project. In 1996, a 10-year concession contract was awarded to a private consortium for the dredging of 76 kilometres of the Martin Garcia Channel to a depth 9.75 metres and a width of 100 metres (the rest of the channel was already deep enough). This gave the new channel the capacity to accommodate vessels 245 metres long and 32 metres wide. The consortium also installed a navigation system of buoys and beacons to improve safety in the channel. The contract enabled the consortium to levy tolls on vessels based on tonnage and draught for a one-way trip in the channel as a way to recoup a portion of its capital investment. Payments from CARP for the consortium’s services also were intended to help to cover capital costs. Larger vessels than before are able to navigate the Martin Garcia Channel, leading to greater transportation efficiency. Because the consortium monitors the tides, winds, and currents, vessels exceeding the design dimensions are still able to use the channel when certain weather conditions are met. The deeper channel has also aided in the development of the ports of Nueva Palmira and Fray Bentos, both in Uruguay. The project faced a financial challenge in 2002 and 2003 because of the financial crisis in Argentina and Uruguay, which led to a withholding of some national payments to the consortium and forced several of the private-sector partners to withdraw from the project.

    "abstract": "Colombia, like many Latin American countries, has experienced a dramatic population increase in urban centres due to economic and social factors. Bogotá, the capital, has absorbed a large portion of those people who have migrated from the rural areas. The population shift created major challenges for Bogotá, including, in the transportation sector, heavy congestion of roadways due to the use of private vehicles and the need for a cost-effective means of transportation for the urban poor. Prior to the introduction of TransMilenio, Bogotá’s public transportation system was inefficient and underused. The Mayor’s Office in Bogotá proposed the bus rapid transit (BRT) system in order to alleviate congestion and provide an efficient and cost-effective means of transportation.  Through strong leadership from the Mayor’s Office, the new public transportation system became operational in a short amount of time. In 1999, TransMilenio S.A. was created, with representation from several public agencies, to manage the system and the public-private partnership (PPP) that has created a thriving urban bus rapid transit system. Under the TransMilenio partnership, the public sector is responsible for the system’s infrastructure and the oversight of the BRT system, while the private sector is in charge of the 8383 system’s operations and maintenance. TransMilenio S.A. oversees the design, planning and monitoring of the system while managing the other entities involved in the system’s operation. The Institute of Urban Development (Instituto de Desarrollo Urbano, or IDU) was placed in charge of building and maintaining the infrastructure necessary to operate the BRT system. Private corporations operate and maintain the buses and perform ticketing and fare collection. The public entities are not reimbursed for their investment in the system since funding is received through taxes, loans and grants. The private entities recover their investments and maintain operations through the collection of fares paid by passengers and therefore bear the demand risk for the project. Both national and local stakeholders were involved in the planning and implementation of the BRT under TransMilenio S.A. Those people with the most experience, government officials and bus operators from the old public transportation system, all provided input into the design and planning of the new BRT system. Open lines of communication allowed concerns to be voiced and resolved so that major roadblocks to the new public transportation system could be avoided. All of the partners who received contracts to operate in TransMilenio were selected by TransMilenio S.A. through an open and competitive bidding process. The first phase of implementation was completed in 2002 and the system is currently under expansion so that more residents of Bogotá can use the public transportation system.",

    "abstract": "Sri Lanka is located in the Indian Ocean only 31 kilometres off the southern coast of India. It is home to approximately 20 million people. The island is strategically situated along the main East-West shipping route and is therefore in a central location for all of South Asia. Because of its location, Sri Lanka was poised to be a strong competitor in the global shipping sector, with three deep water ports: Colombo, Galle and Trincomalee. Colombo, the capital, is the site of a large deep water port (fig. 1). Located on the southeast side of the island, the Colombo Port facilities include two terminals: Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) and Queen Elizabeth Quay (QEQ). From 1987 to 1997, throughput of container traffic for the terminals at Colombo Port increased from less than 500,000 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) to over 1.5 million TEUs. By the mid-1990s, however, this growth was beginning to slow owing to inefficiencies and delays caused by outdated systems and equipment. Projections showed traffic volume levelling off in 2003 or 2004 when the maximum capacity for JCT, the larger and more active of the terminals, would be reached. In addition, estimates at the time indicated that around 40 per cent of west-to-east traffic was being diverted from Colombo Port to more competitive ports outside of Sri Lanka. Regional traffic would continue to 93 grow: forecasts predicted an estimated 7.3 per cent annual growth in traffic to India until 2018 and an overall increase in regional container traffic because of the increasing trade volume. Colombo Port, however, was slowly losing it competitive edge to newer, more modern port facilities and required capital investment to maintain or increase its market share. The desire of the Government of Sri Lanka to remain a true competitor in the shipping sector prompted the creation of a public-private partnership (PPP) in 1999. The South Asia Gateway Terminals (Private) Limited (SAGT partnership) was created by the Sri Lanka Port Authority and several private companies to improve, expand, operate and manage the QEQ terminal through a 30-year build-operate-transfer (BOT) concession. Construction for the expansion of QEQ was completed in August of 2003. Throughput for QEQ increased by 350 per cent from 2000 to 2004, leading to a 30-per cent increase for Colombo Port as a whole. Economic efficiency for the port as a whole has improved because of management techniques used by the SAGT partnership at QEQ and in turn transferred from the SAGT partnership to JCT.",

    "abstract": "Malaysia is a federation of thirteen States and three federal territories located on the Malay Peninsula south of Thailand and the northwest portion of the island of Borneo. The country is home to over 27 million people, with roughly 1.6 million people living in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur (fig. 1), which is situated in the southwest part of Peninsular Malaysia and covers 244 square kilometres. The entire Greater Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area has a population of over 7 million people. Kuala Lumpur has witnessed rapid population and economic growth since the early 1980s. However, one result of this growth has been a marked increase in flash flooding in the area, occurring almost annually. The urbanization of Kuala Lumpur has encroached on the Klang and Gombak rivers, which merge in the centre of the city. The average annual flooding for the Klang River has increased nearly 300 per cent, from about 148 cubic metres per second before 101 Figure 1 Kuala Lumpur. 1985 to 440 cubic metres per second since 1985. The Government of Malaysia has monitored the situation since the early 1970s and responded with the development the Klang River Basin Flood Mitigation Project. It has attempted to control flooding by creating holding ponds and increasing river channel capacity, but this has had only limited success. In 2001, the Government sought proposals for a more effective solution to flooding in order to prevent disruption to the city’s centre during a typical flood event lasting three to six hours. The original idea was for a tunnel to divert and store the storm water, but the idea progressed into the concept of a mixed-use tunnel that would allow traffic flow when the tunnel was empty of water. One factor in this evolution was that for liability reasons, the tunnel had to run below Government-owned land, which led planners to consider locating the tunnel beneath a road. This led to the idea of integrating a tolled motorway into the project. By allowing a portion of the tunnel to be tolled for traffic, private-sector participation in a public-private partnership (PPP) could be secured, reducing the costs of the project for the Government. The Stormwater Management and Road Tunnel (SMART) was developed as a concession. The 12.7-kilometre tunnel project includes a holding pond at the northern entrance, a storage pond at the southern entrance, 9.7 kilometres of stormwater storage, and 3 kilometres of tunnel that doubles as stormwater storage and a motorway. The tunnel begins just before the confluence of the Klang and Ampang Rivers so that flood water can be diverted away from the Klang River, eliminating flooding in the city centre (fig. 2). The whole project provides storage for 3 million cubic metres of water, sufficient to prevent most of the flooding of the centre of the city. The tunnel project operates in three different modes to meet the needs of Kuala Lumpur traffic and prevent flooding. In two of the modes, cars can continue to use the motorway tunnel and storm water is stored in holding ponds and under the motorway portion. In the third mode, the tunnel is closed to traffic and storm water is diverted into all levels of the tunnel. Once the flooding problem has passed and water has drained, the tunnel is dried, cleaned of debris and reopened to traffic, all within 48 hours of the tunnel closing. The motorway tunnel was opened to traffic in May 2007 and the stormwater Figure 2 Tunnel project area. Mixed-use Tunnel, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 103 sections were fully operational a month later. Now when the water level of the Klang River is high, water is diverted into the tunnel, eliminating or greatly reducing flooding in the city centre. In addition, with the option of a tolled motorway, traffic congestion has been reduced on the Southern Gateway into the city.",

    "abstract": "The Philippines is an archipelagic nation in Southeast Asia comprised of 7,107 islands. It is home to over 91 million people, living on approximately 300,000 square kilometres. About half the population lives on the island of Luzon, where the capital, Manila (fig. 1), is located. Congestion in and around the capital is an area of concern for the Government. The North Luzon Expressway is the main transport corridor from the Manila metropolitan area to central and north Luzon; there is no viable alternative for travellers. Built between 1975 and 1977 by the Department of Public Works and Highways, the expressway operated as a toll road. Originally, the expressway was franchised to a private company; however, this was later taken over by the Government and renamed the Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC). Under PNCC management, the expressway was not adequately maintained. In addition, growing traffic volume meant that the expressway capacity could no longer meet commuter needs. By the mid1990s, about 160,000 vehicles travelled on the expressway each day, but with narrow lanes and heavy traffic, congestion became a major problem. The expressway also experienced a large number of avoidable accidents and deaths over the years. 107 In the early 1990s, the Government of the Philippines passed legislation that promoted and regulated the use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in repairing existing infrastructure and building new projects. The Build-OperateTransfer (BOT) Law of 1993 (as amended in 1994) provided the opportunity to utilize a BOT-type approach to modernizing the North Luzon Expressway. With improvements needed for the expressway and limited funding available from the Department of Public Works and Highways, a BOT contract was pursued. A PPP was granted a 30-year BOT contract with the Government to revitalize the Expressway. The North Luzon Expressway underwent repairs and expansion between early 2003 and February 2005, with the project completed on time and under budget. During that time, construction occurred on 14 interchanges, 24 bridges, 31 overpasses and 3 toll plazas. Tolls are assessed to vehicles on the Expressway so that the PPP can recoup its construction costs. Toll rates increased 700 per cent from the original rate of .33 pesos per km to 2.5 pesos per km (effec tively from less than half a United States cent to about $0.05). Despite this sharp increase in the toll rate, the Expressway did not see a drop in daily users.",

    "abstract": "It has long been recognized that economic development is tied to efficient transportation options. Many developing countries struggle with the challenge of how to finance one of the most expensive types of infrastructure projects even while recognizing the potential economic and social benefits. South Africa and Mozambique, however, have developed a major infrastructure project which, if successful, will increase the efficiency of product transport, sparking regional and global trade, and provide additional economic opportunities to their citizens. One crucial element of this project is the N4 Toll Road connecting Pretoria, South Africa, to Maputo, Mozambique. Rehabilitation of a transport route between the two countries began in 1996, shortly after both South Africa and Mozambique held their first democratic elections. Increased political stability in the region allowed the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Government of South Africa to propose new initiatives that focused on economic development, trade and regionalization. To facilitate the cross-border project, the South Africa Department of Transportation organized the South African National Road Agency Limited, and the Mozambique Department of Roads and Bridges created the Administração 113 Nacional de Estradas. These two new agencies were developed to work with a concessionaire who would design, upgrade, construct, operate and maintain a new toll road. After an open-bidding process, a consortium of South African and Mozambican companies won the contract to develop the road and associated infrastructure. The contract was based on a buildoperate-transfer (BOT) model. No government subsidies were provided to the concessionaire for the project. The rehabilitation of the N4 was financed through equity and debt that was negotiated by the concessionaire. Operations and maintenance costs were to be paid for by revenue generated through the collection of tolls. Traffic volume on the toll road is dependent upon the economic development of communities along the route, so the concessionaire has a high stake in other related projects as well. In the beginning, the project lacked public support. This led the concessionaire to agree to reduce tariffs for regular users and to begin providing services, such as twenty-four-hour road patrols to assist motorists, to justify the cost to local commuters. The Government has continually shown strong support for the toll road and attempted to appease residents adversely affected by the project. Use of the highway has steadily increased over the years, showing an acceptance of this public-private partnership (PPP).",

    "abstract": "The southern India State of Tamil Nadu has been a leader in the area of urban sector reforms and has established an efficient framework to carry out this process. One of the tools that it has used for a variety of infrastructure projects has been public-private partnerships (PPPs). The government’s objective has been to facilitate the development of modern urban infrastructure while providing an enabling environment for the participation of the private sector in this development. The East Coast Road project is one of the resulting PPP projects managed by an entity that is itself a PPP. The first of the Tamil Nadu government’s series of PPPs for roadways was commissioned in 1998 as the Tamil Nadu Road Development Company Ltd. (TNRDC). This enterprise was structured as a model PPP between the public agency known as the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) and the private consortium, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS). This PPP was intended to leverage State resources by encouraging private-sector investment. The purpose of TNRDC was to improve the small roads connecting the State capital, Chennai, with the town of Cuddalore. The objective was to reduce traffic congestion, facilitate local business and trade, and reduce the local air pollution. 123 This was done by upgrading the road design, employing contemporary construction techniques and operating the road using the latest technology. The project was also expected to serve as a catalyst for private-sector investment and participation in infrastructure development. However, this initial agreement lacked a sufficient financial base, which slowed maintenance work in the project. As a result, the road was characterized by high levels of accidents, poor signage and absence of road markings. Pavement failures were also seen within two years of the initial development. To correct these deficiencies, the TNRDC negotiated a new contract for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the 113.2-km East Coast Road between the cities of Chennai and Pondicherry, via the city of Mahabalipuram, at a cost of $12.6 million. The government approved the project in principle on 11 February 2000 and the concession agreement was signed in December 2000. The new PPP contract was renegotiated as a rehabilitate-improve-maintain-operate-transfer (RIMOT) agreement, which included a number of improved specifications. Work under this agreement began in February 2001, and a substantial portion was completed by December of the same year. The improved road began operating as a toll road on 24 March 2002. The proactive support from the government of Tamil Nadu was critical to the long-term success of this project. There was significant interdepartmental coordination, transparency in bidding and contracting, and assistance in toll enforcement. Because this project became extremely successful, this framework serves as a model for projects with high maintenance and operations costs.",

    "abstract": "Cartagena is a city of almost 900,000 people on the northern coast of Colombia. It serves as the capital of one of the country’s departments (States), an economic hub and a popular tourist destination. However, prior to 1995, water/wastewater service and its provider were extremely unreliable – less than 70 per cent of the city’s households had water connections and less than 55 per cent had sewage service. Major portions of the population, particularly those with lower incomes, were provided water by private vendors, and those with connections to the water system frequently experienced water pressure so low that their service was practically nonexistent. The pre-existing system operated with substantial financial losses and had insufficient funding for maintenance or improvement of the system. Substantial political pressure from the citizens of Cartagena led to the creation of a public-private partnership (PPP) to repair and operate the system. Under the leadership of the Mayor, in 1994 the Municipal Council of the city approved the creation of an “empresa mixta” (mixed enterprise) that combined the resources of the public works department and a Spanish water firm. Together, they operate under the name, Aguas de Cartagena, or AGUACAR. 135 Despite some initial opposition and suspicion of AGUACAR, significant changes in service were quickly apparent. The high percentage of non-revenue water (NRW) caused by leaks in the system was significantly reduced, increasing the water pressure to existing customers. AGUACAR began immediate service to those not connected to the system by establishing a system of water-truck deliveries to serve these communities. The financing for these came in part from a restructuring of the tariff system to incorporate cross-subsidies under which more affluent customers helped to subsidize the water rates of lower-income families. AGUACAR made marked improvements in water-supply and sewage services. By 2005, water supply coverage increased to 99 per cent of the population and sewage coverage rose to 75 per cent. Support for AGUACAR remains high as community members enjoy the benefits of an improved, more reliable water supply and sewage service.",

    "abstract": "For over thirty years, the water services in Cochabamba, the third-largest city in Bolivia with a population of 600,000, were managed by the city’s Servicio Municipal de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado (SEMAPA). The system was characterized by significant maintenance and administrative problems. Only half of the population was being served, on a highly irregular basis, and the water often did not meet public health standards. To address these problems, the national legislature passed the Drinking Water and Sanitation Law in October of 1999, creating the legal framework for public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the water sector. A competitive bidding process did not produce a successful bid but did lead to the formation of an international consortium of companies from Bolivia, Spain and the United States. Under the name of Aguas del Tunari (AdT), the consortium was awarded a 40-year concession in October 1999 and began operations immediately. The concession included operation of the existing water supply system and construction within two years of the $214 million Misicuni Multipurpose Project (MMP), which used the River Misicuni for electricity generation, irrigation and water supply to the city. Also, the consortium was obligated to pay the outstanding debt of SEMAPA. 145 In the first two months of operation, AdT increased supplied water by 30 per cent  simply through repairs and technical enhancements. However, because of the contract’s provision for construction of the MMP and servicing of the previous debts of SEMAPA, an average tariff increase of 35 per cent was agreed on during contractual negotiations. Public officials were to inform the public about the size and rationale for the increase but did not carry through on this commitment. By January 2000 (only three months into the operations), significant public opposition emerged. The Coalition in Defence of Water and Life, a broad alliance of professional associations and civil society organizations, led a series of protests against the contract and the increase in water tariffs. Within weeks, public demonstrations prompted the government water superintendent to roll back the rates and force a refund of the difference paid. The protests continued and escalated to the point that in April, the military was sent into Cochabamba to restore calm. In the deteriorating situation, AdT personnel abandoned their offices and the Government cancelled the contract. In November 2001, AdT filed a request for arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) regarding the assets expropriated by the Government of Bolivia when the contract was cancelled. Subsequently, Cochabamba returned to the PPP model to address its water problems but avoiding the problems of the first PPP. In December 2004, a new partnership, the Water for All (Agua para Todos, or ApT), was formed with SEMAPA, a private-sector consortium (Plastioforte), local communities and a non-profit foundation. The previous SEMAPA debt and the MMP were not included in this new partnership. Under the Your Water (Agua Tuya) programme, the ApT partnership is part of an initiative to unite stakeholders and improve coordination and efficiency by combining the resources of the various partners. As part of this programme, Plastioforte has constructed secondary water systems in coordination with SEMAPA, which planned where to direct its main pipelines.",

    "abstract": "In 1995, the Government of Senegal initiated significant reforms in the urban water sector to improve service delivery and increase medium-term storage, production and distribution of water in the capital, Dakar. The reforms consisted of dissolving the State-run water company, Société nationale d’exploitation des eaux du Sénégal (SONEES), and creating a new asset-holding company, Société nationale des eaux du Sénégal (SONES), which owned all the fixed assets for the Government and would function as an independent sector regulator. SONES was created to be a small, financially autonomous unit that would employ qualified staff and would be responsible for investments and setting of tariffs. It was also decided that the production and distribution of water services would be placed in the hands of an operating company run by a private professional operator that would own at least 51 per cent of the water facility, with the other 49 per cent owned by a mixture of Senegalese investors, former employees of the original State-run water company (SONEES) and the State. This public-private partnership (PPP) has been operating in Dakar since 1996, with Sénégalaise des eaux (SDE), a subsidiary of a major French water company, managing the water system under a 10-year operation and maintenance contract. The terms 157 of the contract allow the government to fine SDE if it fails to achieve the specific performance targets. These targets include an objective later included in the Millennium Development Goals, which is providing water that meets World Health Organization (WHO) quality standards. The programme has been largely successful in improving the quality and quantity of water delivery in Dakar. Between 1996 and 2003, water production increased by 18 per cent with the addition of 81,000 new household connections and 400 standpipes. An early dispute over the failure of the public sector to make agreed investments, and ambitious initial technical-efficiency targets, led to renegotiation of the original terms of the contract with the assistance of a third-party consultant. The successful renegotiation had a significant positive impact on the financial health of SDE and underlined the inherent strength of the reformed institutional structure of the Senegalese water sector. The programme is regarded by the World Bank as a model for PPPs in subSaharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "The 26 December 2004 tsunami in South Asia was a catastrophe of record proportions and far-reaching impact. The immediate response included an outpouring of donations and volunteer efforts that aided significantly in meeting the short-term needs of those affected by the disaster. However, longer-term solutions were essential to meet the demand for a wide range of infrastructure restorations in the tsunami-affected countries. One of the most urgent longer-term requirements was the reconstruction of water and wastewater systems for reasons of public health as well as economic development/redevelopment. In addition to the needs of the general public for potable water and good sanitation, many industries require a reliable source of this same potable water for their continued operation. The restoration and general improvement of these systems call for a protracted, focused effort that is both capital and technology intensive and is therefore an excellent candidate for publicprivate partnerships (PPPs). In order to encourage the transition from short-term relief efforts to reconstruction projects and to ensure clean water supplies in compliance with World Health Organization (WHO) standards, a large multi-national soft drink company entered into a PPP with the United Nations Development Programme 169 (UNDP) and the United Nations Foundation (UNF). This PPP, known as the Tsunami Relief Partnership (TRP), was unique in that it fostered partnerships at the local level in a number of tsunamidevastated areas. The goal of each of these local partnerships is to undertake a sustainable, community-based approach to providing access to water and sanitation services for meeting redevelopment needs. Local partnerships have been launched in Indonesia, the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The initial funding for much of this effort was provided in equal shares by both the private company and the United Nations. In addition, the private-sector partner provides management expertise to ensure the most efficient and appropriate use of the resources of both the primary partnership and each of the subsidiary (local) ones. Today, partnerships are under way in communities in all four countries to improve the quality of water supplies and public sanitation facilities and to develop community-based water resource management and long-term water supply activities.",

    "abstract": "In the 1990s, water and wastewater services in Manila were unsafe and unreliable and most residents were underserved while others had no access to the systems at all. In 1995, the Government of the Philippines enacted legislation that allowed Manila’s water agency to enter into a public-private partnership (PPP). The idea of using the private sector for water/wastewater services came from the earlier successes of President Fidel V. Ramos in mobilizing private resources to solve the Philippines’ power crisis in the early 1990s. In 1996, Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) began the process that led to the signing of concession agreements in early 1997. Metro Manila was split into two zones (East and West) to be run by two different concessionaires. The focus of this case study is the concession agreement for the West Zone. In 1997, MWSS signed a 25-year concession agreement with a consortium that consisted of a private Philippine corporation and an international water company. The Government hoped that the concessionaire, Maynilad Water Services, Inc., would be able to provide western Manila’s population of approximately 6 million with an uninterrupted water supply, expand the water and sewage service coverage, and improve access for those who were unable to afford piped water. 181 After the contracts were signed, MWSS split into two entities: one to manage the concession agreements and another to regulate the concessionaires. Maynilad was responsible for the maintenance, operation and investment obligations associated with water/wastewater services as well as paying 90 per cent of the old debts of MWSS through yearly concession fees. The concessionaire would generate revenue by collecting usage tariffs from consumers, so it had a great interest in regularizing supply and expanding service coverage. Manila’s residents strongly supported the concession agreement that promised better service at lower rates. At first, the concession agreement was effective in increasing residents’ access to water and sewerage services, but inefficiencies in the old system, coupled with external factors and a poor outline of responsibilities in the contract, put a strain on Maynilad’s resources. Non-revenue water (NRW), lost through leaky pipes or illegal connections into the system, caused the concessionaire to forfeit millions of dollars in revenue each year. El Niño effects reduced Manila’s water supply and the Asian financial crisis devalued the Philippine peso, which also hindered Maynilad’s ability to generate revenue and pay off debts. In the end, disagreements over contractual obligations led to both public- and private-sector attempts to terminate the contract. In 2003, an arbitration court decided that neither side had the authority to end the agreement. Since then, MWSS and Maynilad have continued working together to supply western Manila with water and sewerage services, but consumers have had to pay a large price for this poorly constructed arrangement.",

    "abstract": "Indonesia, the largest archipelagic State in the world, is comprised of 17,508 islands and shares land borders with Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste. It has an abundant supply of renewable water resources but it has had limited success in providing potable water for its citizens.1 Experts estimate that only 40 per cent of all urban residents have access to piped water, with the majority of people relying on groundwater. During the twentieth century, access to adequate water improved slightly, but funding priority has typically been given to improving and expanding irrigation systems instead of the drinking water supply. Jakarta, located on Java Island, is the capital and largest city of Indonesia and provides an example of the water crisis that is seen throughout the country. In 1997, only 42 per cent of residents had access to piped water, and many of these people still relied in part on groundwater or bottled water. The remainder of the residents experienced not only inequality in access to piped water connections but also in the quality of water. This was in part owing to a tariff structure under the public water util 193 1 Indonesia ranks 58th out of 180 countries for available renewable water resources, with 13,381 cubic metres per capita per annum. Despite this high ranking and relatively large quantity of water, Indonesia ranks just 110th out of 122 countries for water quality because pollution is high and sanitation is poor. (Source: United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 2003, The United Nations World Water Development Report: Water for People, Water for Life.) ity that created a disincentive to connect poor households. In wealthy and middleclass neighbourhoods, residents normally had 24-hour-a-day access to piped water suitable for washing, cooking and bathing. In the disadvantaged neighbourhoods, the vast majority of residents obtained their water from community ground pumps, from which the flow was intermittent and the quality of water was poor. The groundwater often had high levels of waste contamination (because of the lack of an adequate sewerage system) and suffered from frequent pressure losses. As a result, lower-income residents were forced to purchase water from vendors at prices that were 10 to 15 times the normal residential water tariff. In 1997, the Government decided to turn to the private sector for help with the water system in Jakarta, in part because of pressure from international financial institutions to utilize privatesector funding. To establish opportunities for two Indonesian companies, the public water utility was split into two companies: one east and the other west of the Ciliwung River. Two major international water companies bid to provide piped water under this new arrangement. Each company was paired with a local Indonesian company because under then-President Suharto, all foreign companies were required to partner with an Indonesian company if they wanted to operate a utility network. While it was not unusual for a Government to require such a pairing, in Indonesia, the pairing was with companies personally linked to the President. Two PPPs were formed to provide water to both east and west Jakarta (hereafter collectively referred to as “Jakarta Water”). Ambitious targets were set and the contracts required significant investments by private-sector partners. However, because of inadequate specifics in the contract, insufficient Government participation in the partnerships and poorly designed incentives, the PPPs cannot be deemed successful. The Asian financial crisis struck a few months after the contracts were signed and led to political and economic turmoil in Indonesia and the resignation of the President. The rupiah faced a strong devaluation and PAM Jaya (the municipal water utility, which entered into the PPP agreements) did not want to raise water tariffs to offset the devaluation because people were already facing rising food and fuel costs. As a result, PAM Jaya accumulated additional debt and was unable to make the contractually agreed payments to the private companies that were intended to offset the difference Figure 1 Zones of eastern and western Jakarta. Urban Water, Jakarta, Indonesia 195 between tariff revenues and the volume of water actually delivered. After ten years of operation, very little has changed in Jakarta. While some new connections were made, the additional connections were far short of the contractual targets, and while the cost of water has increased, the quality of service is little improved. Increases in the tariff rate of over 30 per cent at a time were implemented on several occasions. Residents were not happy with the new prices, especially when the water quality did not improve; customers are paying more for the same inadequate service. The vast majority of residents still rely on groundwater and high-priced vendors to meet their potable water needs. For most residents, piped water continues to remain unavailable.",

    "abstract": "The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States and a major area of both recreational and commercial fishing for the State of Maryland. The environmental quality of the Bay has been seriously threatened by wastewater discharges from growing population centres and minimal controls of agricultural runoff (both fertilizers and animal byproducts). In response, area governments have made restoration of the Bay an environmental priority, including an increased interest in land and wetlands management. However, both State and local governments lack the financial and personnel capability to address many of the concerns. It was in this situation that the Chesapeake Forest Project was created. In 1999, a private company sought to divest its holdings in the forested areas of the Eastern Shore of the Bay, but the State of Maryland lacked both the funding to acquire the land and the personnel resources to manage the land once purchased. In addition, the cessation of timber harvesting on the offered lands would have caused an unacceptable loss of employment in the region. Recognizing its fiscal and personnel limitations, the State entered into a phased-in public-private partnership (PPP) to purchase and manage the land. A pilot phase tested the concept of the partnership and ultimately fully implemented this 203 contractual relationship that allows the private-sector partner to harvest timber in a limited portion of the lands and manage the entire property according to environmental standards closely monitored and supervised by the public sector. The revenues from the timber harvest generate the necessary income to make the project completely economically selfsustained and at the same time generate revenues for both the State of Maryland and local governments.",

    "abstract": "Under this project, Sustainable Agriculture and Environmental Voluntary Action (SEVA) worked towards the rehabilitation of Anaikoil, a village in Nagapattinam District. The project aimed at desilting and constructing farm ponds, which are traditional water recharging systems in the village. The desilting was to be done by manual labourers in the village who had lost their employment after the tsunami. This would ensure that more ponds were desilted than had been planned. As of the time of writing of the case study report, 65 of the 72 ponds had been desilted. A hundred acres of land that had been salinated by the tsunami were to be reclaimed through organic farming methods, and the farmers were being trained in the use of these traditional technologies, which had mostly been lost. In addition to these activities, the issue of lack of fodder for the large cattle population led to the initiation of a fodder propagation unit in the village. The unit was to be started on villageowned land, with the involvement of some interested farmers. In addition, to improve the overall status of livestock and cattle in Anaikoil and seven other villages of the Maneckapangu panchayat, a veterinary clinic would be set up in Anaikoil. The land for the fodder propagation unit and the clinic had to be approved by the gram panchayat (village council). Another activity undertaken was the desilting of the Sulagumooku channel, which brings water from the Mahimalayaru River. This channel had not been desilted for 20 years. This project was financed by the Development of Humane Action Foundation. Anaikoil is a tsunami-affected agricultural village that belongs to Maneckapangu panchayat in Nagapattinam District in India. The village, which covers 436 acres, has a population of 1,033 (521 males and 512 females). The farmers depend mainly on the cultivation of groundnuts for their livelihood and most of the farmers have their own land for agriculture. Among the 169 beneficiaries of the project, 45 farmers are landless while the remaining 124 own land for groundnut cultivation. As the farmers’ cultivation fields are adjacent to the seashore, there are problems relating to the availability of fresh water for irrigation. To resolve this problem, the villagers had developed a unique system for harvesting and storing water for their farming purposes. These traditional water storage structures are farm Reviving, Replenishing and Rejuvenating Anaikoil: India 27 ponds, which are man-made ponds of varying size – small, medium or large – that can retain water for irrigation purposes (figs. 1a and 1b). Traditionally, these structures had been dug by the villagers for the past 30 years (fig. 2). After the tsunami disaster, seven village farm ponds were affected by salinization. Most of the farmers’ land was inundated with salt water, and the farmers lost that year’s crops. In this situation, with almost no income, the annual activity of desilting their farm ponds was an expense that they could not incur and the ponds were left without desilting. Most of them had almost dried up after two years. Many of the farmers in all the villages in the panchayat were given dairy cattle or livestock after the tsunami, but this increase was not supplemented by an increase in grazing land. The veterinary clinic for these villages was seven kilometres away, which meant that a sick animal had to walk this distance before being treated since there was no other way of transporting it. The setting up of a clinic in the area would mean respite not only for the eight villages in the panchayat but also for the other surrounding villages in nearby taluks.",

    "abstract": "Prior to the earthquake, the Mino Raharjo collective had been well known as an up-and-coming gourmet fish-farming business. Through research with Gadjah Mada University, it produced its own fish feed low in chemicals and was actively working to develop a regional aquaculture network. Direct funding to the Mino Raharjo gourami fish collective enabled the villagers of Jambidan to repair their earthquake-damaged aquaculture infrastructure, hence ensuring a rapid return to preearthquake livelihood activities. Through assisting the recovery of the community’s aquaculture industry, the project supported the sustainable use of fields laid to waste through clay extraction for the manufacture of bricks. In addition to rebuilding infrastructure, grant funds were used to expand the collective’s networking and marketing capacity along with documenting the group’s sustainable production processes as both a marketing tool and an educational aid for other emerging aquaculture businesses. This project directly assisted a selfmanaged community group striving for more sustainable livelihoods and solutions to re-establish its primary economic activity, allowing the community greater participation and control of its own recovery. Through the creation of long-term viable businesses on otherwise depleted soils, the project ensured the ongoing security of land tenure to poor rural farming communities that otherwise are often forced to sell their land at low market prices. By supporting the development of a network of aquaculture farmers, the project improved local farmers’ access to markets and increased the flow of resources and knowledge-sharing on sustainable practices such as the production of chemical-free fish feed. The earthquake caused extensive damage to the houses and agricultural infrastructure of the village of Jambidan, striking a crippling blow to the otherwise successful fish-farming collective (figs. 1 and 2). In less than a minute, over 60 per cent of the fish farmers of Jambidan (10 per cent of the community) lost their source of income (source: Survey Result from Local NGO, Nawakamal). The Mino Raharjo collective lacked the capital reserves to recover from this extraordinary level of damage without assistance. The total finances required to completely rebuild and restock their businesses was estimated to be in excess of 1.2 billion rupiahs.",

    "abstract": "The villages of Muruh and Mutihan have had years of high background poverty and limited earthquake experience, which led to low-quality housing construction that quickly crumbled under the force of the earthquake of May 2006 (fig. 1). Prior to the earthquake, a group of newly liberated farmers had begun to search for more alternative and sustainable agricultural systems out of concern over the high level of chemicals to which intensive tobacco farming had exposed them. With the assistance of the Independent Farmers Secretariat (SETAM) and the Rapid Agrarian Conflict Appraisal (RACA) Institute, the farmers had established the Muruh and Mutihan low-chemical farmers’ collective. The high level of destruction experienced in the Gantiwarno Sub-district left the members of the Muruh non-chemical farmers’ collective living in tents and reliant on aid distribution for their survival. The objective of the project was to support the recovery of this pre-existing sustainable farming group. NGOs had been directed by both the provincial and national governments not to assist with permanent housing as the government had said that it would provide sufficient reconstruction funds for all families to rebuild on their own. Unfortunately, distribution of reconstruction assistance in Central Java was greatly delayed. In addition, many families had fallen through the safety net, failing to qualify or simply absent on the day of counting. The community-led initiative to build temporary houses out of bamboo emerged in response to immediate need and to which materials were readily available locally rather than through a desire to be innovative (fig. 2). Survivors were also heavily traumatized by the earthquake, the ensuing aftershocks and heavy rains over the first few days. With forceful aftershocks still being felt 15 months later, survivors felt that lightweight construction material such as bamboo would be less dangerous in the event of collapse. Naturally fertilized, pesticide-free rice is now produced by the community and supplied to markets in Yogyakarta Figure 1 Mother and child in front of former house. Figure 2 Muruh resident beside bamboo shelter in mid-transition to a permanent house. Shelter for Economic Recovery: Indonesia 51 and Semarang, avoiding the dependency on chemical fertilizers as prescribed by the green-revolution concept of agricultural intensification. Yet it will take many years before the area’s heavily polluted soils are finally free of the pesticide and chemical fertilizer residues left by years of intensive tobacco farming. The project aimed to support the recovery of a pre-existing sustainable farming group. Without assistance, such groups could easily return to past non-sustainable practices. This community-based rehabilitation process supports a rights-based approach to reconstruction and rehabilitation in post-disaster situations. The supported community has control of its own recovery, empowering villagers in a situation that may otherwise feel out of their control. By supporting alternative sustainable livelihoods, the project sought to support farmers in maintaining land tenure and ownership, reducing urban drift and assisting farmers in exercising their rights to organize and access their land and resources. Many of the transitional shelter projects in Yogyakarta/Central Java had been implemented in a top-down approach by large non-governmental organizations (NGOs) overly focused on the “deliverable” measure of units constructed. Such projects often ignore the important aspects of community empowerment that can be achieved by bottom-up, community-led initiatives that this project exemplifies.",

    "abstract": "Thimarafushi is one of the islands that were badly hit by the 2004 tsunami. Both during the tsunami and in its aftermath, the islanders were exposed to health hazards owing to lack of awareness regarding the safe disposal of waste. The project, “Managing and Implementation of Waste Disposal Mechanism in Thaa Thimarafushi”, is a second-phase project of the tsunami recovery scheme funded by the South-South Grants Facility (SSGF) and implemented in the Maldives by the Thimarafushi Youth Club. The project began in January 2007 and was still in progress at the time of writing of the case study report. The project aim is to increase awareness among the island community regarding the handling and safe disposal of waste as well as environmental degradation and the health consequences of improper handling of garbage in homes and in public areas. The overall objective of the project is to implement a safe, economically viable and environmentally friendly mechanism for waste disposal for the island and reduce the incidence of disease, environmental degradation and other consequences of improper waste disposal. Under this project, the community has been engaged in identifying and implementing good procedures for waste management through raising awareness initially of a core group of participants at a workshop and later of all households on the island. The grant also funded the procurement of equipment for waste collection and disposal such as household bins, large collection bins and a vehicle for transportation of waste from the collection points to the Island Waste Management Centre. Segregated household waste will be disposed of at the collection points which will be cleared by the waste management staff of the Thimarafushi Youth Club and delivered to the Island Waste Management Centre. The Club’s disposal vehicle will also be available for hire by the community for direct disposal of large items. Up to the time of writing, awarenessraising activities had been conducted and some change in attitudes and actions among the community had been witnessed as a result. Less dumping in public places has made the island cleaner and the beaches less polluted. All the equipment is being procured. A significant increase in problems of waste management has been evident throughout the Maldives in recent years. The management of solid and hazardous waste has emerged to be one of the country’s greatest challenges, with the rapid growth in population on small islands, changing consumption patterns, and transportation difficulties resulting in increased levels of pollution and public health concerns. The tsunami compounded the problem, with large piles of debris accumulated on the islands, ranging from broken glass and battery acid to rubble from damaged buildings. The central waste management facility of Thilafushi is located near the capital, Male’, but no formal management systems exist in the atolls, with the exception of two sites, one in the far north and one in the far south of the archipelago. Thimarafushi, located 222.4 km south of Male’, is one of the most populated islands in Thaa Atoll (fig. 1). It is widely used as a transit point for interisland travellers and fishermen, and with the Atoll Education Centre located in Thimarafushi, there has been in-migration of students from other islands as well. While the registered population of the island stood at just over 2,400 as of September 2006, residents claim that it is safe to assume that close to 3,000 people would be on the island at any given point in time. The people of Thimarafushi have been experiencing many negative consequences of dumping rubbish on the island, with a general lack of awareness and hence no practice of hygienic/safe or sustainable methods of waste disposal at the household and industrial levels. During the planning process, the Thimarafushi Youth Club estimated that, on average, around 90 kg of food waste were being produced on the island daily. It was found that over 90 per cent of households did not know about safe waste disposal, and many were using dustbins without lids in their homes. Public health issues such as water-borne diseases (e.g., diarrhoea) and mosquitoborne disease were prevalent as a result. Bad odours and unpleasant scenes of garbage strewn on the beach were the norm and coral destruction was being witnessed around the island.",

    "abstract": "Kahawa and Paraliya are two of the villages in Galle District that were the worst hit by the 2004 tsunami. The main objective of the project was to provide infrastructure facilities, including the water supply scheme under construction at the time of writing of the case study report. When completed, this facility will directly benefit 21 families in the village of Kahawa. Another example is the community hall that was completed and is operational; the Department of Public Health conducts regular health clinics there. The restoration and promotion of lost livelihoods in selected villages of Galle District was another area of focus. In general, the project was able to achieve its targeted objectives. Livelihood activities of 33 members were successfully re-established through a revolving-loan scheme. These loans are extended through the community-based organizations (CBOs) of the respective villages. The loans help them to resume their former income-generating activities. The amount of the loans that they are able to obtain is based on the nature of their venture. The beneficiary must repay the loan plus interest, which is charged at a minimal rate determined by the CBO. The interest is calculated on the reducing balance, and the loan beneficiaries are very appreciative of this method, having been accustomed to paying exorbitant amounts of interest to professional moneylenders. The repayment rate of the loans has been very good. The interest earned is credited to the CBOs themselves and is held in a bank account. Figure 1 Map of the Galle district affected by the tsunami on 26 December 2004 [courtesy of SERTIT] Restoring a Fractured Psyche: Sri Lanka 71 The communities have realized that these earnings enable them to extend loan facilities to more members of their village community. Most of the people who have resumed their former occupations have found a stable market for their products. Hikkaduwa Grama Niladhari (GN) Division in Galle District (fig. 1) is an area that bore the brunt of the tidal waves on the southwestern coast of Sri Lanka. The villages of Kahawa and Paraliya also reported very high numbers of casualties. According to statistics, 1,588 out of 23,174 deaths in Galle District were reported from the Hikkaduwa GN Division. As for damage to infrastructure, 3,164 houses were completely ruined (table 1). The Development Education Institute for Human and Environmental Resource Management (DEIHERM), an NGO, had been working in this area well before the tsunami. It had carried out projects such as HIV/AIDS awareness programmes, youth camps and other activities. DEI HERM was familiar with the area and well acquainted with the people of those villages, having interacted with them before. This well-established rapport was of immense use to the NGO when it set out to identify the needs of the tsunamiafflicted people there. Immediately after the tsunami, many relief projects were implemented in the area, providing the communities with their basic amenities. However, during the survey carried out by DEIHERM to assess the needs of the community, the NGO realized that there was no strategy to rebuild destroyed livelihoods. It was evident, therefore, that livelihood development was the major need. Destroyed infrastructure facilities were also identified for reconstruction. There are also groups of people engaged in other small enterprises such as the production of rope, mats and rugs made with coconut fibre or coir, while there are others involved in the cultivation of vegetables in their home gardens. The chief occupation of the coastal village communities of Kahawa and Paraliya is fishing. However, along the southern coastal areas of the island, the coconut palm also serves as a lifeline to many as does the palmyra palm on the northern and eastern coasts. Several affected people were engaged in the cottage industry of turning out coir-based products. It is said that nothing in the coconut palm goes to waste: the fibrous husk of the coconut is cleaned and the coir strands are used to make a variety of items such as rope, mats and brooms. Total number of families affected 11,514 Families displaced 878 Deaths 1,588 Missing persons 291 Houses - completely destroyed 3,164 Houses – partly damaged 2,236 Families with lost livelihoods 8,709 Table 1 Tsunami devastation in Galle District. Other groups of people were engaged in the cultivation of vegetables in their home gardens. Some coastal dwellers there were earning their living by running small-scale grocery shops, often in an annex to their house; most of them lost everything. Forty-three families (comprising 103 individuals) were among the worst affected by the tsunami.",

    "abstract": "Ampara District is located approximately 300 km from Colombo in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. The coastal area of this district was one of the worst hit in the 2004 tsunami disaster. Many fishermen perished along with their families. Large extents of settlements on the lowlying coast were washed away. Next to nothing was left standing for up to 100 metres from the sea. Most of the dwellings had been crushed by waves of up to 10 metres.  In some places, the waves reached up to three kilometres inland, making these already-poor communities even more vulnerable. The main objective of the project was to assist nearly 500 tsunami-affected peo ple. During phase 1, the South-south Grants Facility (SSGF) provided eight grants totalling $60,900 to affected areas in the district. The grants were clustered into three projects based on their geographic locations. The amounts allocated as separate grants ranged from $4,000 to $13,500, with the amount determined after ascertaining the size and feasibility of each of the project activities proposed by the non-governmental organization (NGO) partners. Only three grants representing overall SSGF activities in the district are presented in this case study.

Total 33,500 490 Summary of the South-South Grants Facility Grants Helping Victims of Twin Disasters: Sri Lanka 83 Environmental Protection and Economic Development (OEPED) – adopted different approaches to providing assistance to the tsunami-affected people. NEUF assisted the community to restore livelihoods through a microcredit scheme and formed a community-based organization (CBO) to manage the revolving fund. Training in beauty culture was provided to 20 females. NSRC used its grants primarily to assist 51 beneficiaries to restore their livelihoods through conditional grants. It also made tools and equipment available to the affected people. NSRC made it mandatory for each beneficiary to prepare a business management plan when applying for a grant. It also ensured that the loan applicants maintained environmentally friendly households, especially with respect to proper waste management, and set up home gardens. The grant awarded to OEPED was used to provide a drinking water facility to a community in a tsunami resettlement village. A well and an overhead tank were constructed and pipelines were laid to supply water to 20 households. The resumption of civil unrest in 2005 had an adverse effect on project activities such as inordinate delays in the transportation of building materials; however, the results obtained were very positive. The three NGOs successfully completed their activities and afforded the communities the maximum possible benefits. In Ampara District, the highest death toll and the worst infrastructure damage were recorded on the densely populated eastern coastline, where the death toll was 10,400 and an estimated 105,560 people were forced to seek temporary shelter (fig. 1). The protective beach vegetation Figure 1 Eastern coast of Sri Lanka. cover was lost because of houses built on the fringes of the shoreline. The problem was acute in Kalmunai, where two SSGF projects were located. According to a survey done by NSRC in collaboration with the University of Peradeniya in selected locations of the Kalmunai area, there were 16 dominant livelihood categories, of which daily wage earners, part-time farmers, owners of small businesses and fishermen were in the majority.  Also, 8.2 per cent of the labour force was involved in activities such as tailoring and the hand-loom industry. The people in Ampara had endured more than two decades of civil unrest and many were living in temporary shelters and depended on State and donor agencies for their sustenance.  The 2002 Ceasefire Agreement brought them a ray of hope and people began returning to their homes. The 2004 tsunami, however, made their already-sparse living conditions much worse. They were in desperate need of assistance to resume their lives virtually from scratch.  In spite of the huge inflow of assistance to the area, everyone could not be included in the livelihood projects owing to financial limitations. The SSGF funds helped to fill this gap. The village of Attimunai in Pottuvil had been abandoned by the community in 1992 owing to ethnic strife; the community moved to adjoining villages in the coastal belt. For months after the tsunami, the community lived in transitional homes with minimal facilities. Ironically, the community members were relocated to their old village, which had not been inhabited for the past 10 years.  An NGO, the Small Fisheries Federation, with the financial assistance from the international community, constructed 59 houses for tsunami-affected people, most of whom were fishermen.  The households had no proper drinking water facilities as the water from the three tube wells was too saline for consumption. The OEPED project to supply drinking water was therefore a boon.",

    "abstract": "The project aimed to support the construction of a boat maintenance centre for Kor Lanta, a small island district in Krabi Province, southern Thailand. The tsunami of 26 December 2004 had damaged not only hundreds of traditional fishing boats but also the only boat maintenance centre in the community, which was completely wiped out. The project to build a new centre would benefit at least 258 fishing households in eight villages on the island. The project was initiated within the broader framework of the Lanta Community Development Master Plan, which was formulated through a public participation process as a response to the tsunami and other development-related problems that required the community’s proactive and collective efforts to overcome them. The overall objective of the Master Plan is to promote sustainable development and sustainable management of natural resources, tourism and other livelihood activities through a culturally appropriate and participatory process with the active engagement of all stakeholder groups, including local communities. The project to construct a community centre for maintaining small-scale boats was both a means and an end to achieving the overall objective of the Master Plan. While its primary focus is on livelihoods, i.e., to reduce costs relating to livelihood activities, the process to manage the centre involves genuine participation of the communities at every stage and applies indigenous as well as modern knowledge in its operation. The project was implemented in Kor Lanta, one of the districts in Krabi Province. The district is made up of 53 islands, 9 of which are inhabited. The population of these islands comprises three major ethnic groups: Morgan (or sea gypsies), Malay and Chinese. Geologically, the western zone of the district has a long beach that has attracted a large number of tourists almost all year-round, especially after the tsunami, which had badly damaged several old tourist sites in nearby provinces. The tourism industry has expanded quickly and in a rather chaotic, environmentally damaging manner, and more hotels, resorts and restaurants have been constructed to accommodate the tourists. People on the western coast earn their living mainly from tourism and associated businesses. The eastern zone is rather different; it has plenty of land for small-scale farming and housing. Most of the villages along the eastern coast have been there for a long time and still maintain traditional ways of earning livelihoods, such as coastal fishing, rice farming, raising cattle and goats, and growing Pará rubber trees. There is also a large, long-stretching mangrove forest that covers an area of around 10,000 rai.1 Small Island…Smart Ideas: Thailand 93 Economically, the average income of the Kor Lanta District is lowest in Krabi Province, around 20,000-30,000 baht/ person/year. Local people must cope with the high cost of living due to tourism, low prices of agricultural commodities and seafood, a sharp depletion of coastal resources, and limited access to quality public services. There are also increasing worries that the fast expansion of the tourism business will have an adverse impact on their local tradition and environment. The tsunami of December 2004, on the other hand, turned a crisis into an opportunity. It brought people together to seriously discuss common problems. The Lanta Community Development Network (LCDN) was established and a master plan was developed to reflect the community’s vision and aspiration for their lives and the future of their native community (fig. 1). As part of the Master Plan, a community self-reliance centre would be established in one large compound (fig. 2), with several operational centres for diverse activities. These centres would include a mangrove eco-system study centre, a home-stay accommodation, a nature-study walking trail, a disposalwater treatment centre, a cooperative shop for fishing gear, freshwater fish ponds, a vocational training centre and 1 One rai equals 1,600 square metres.

The budget to construct this centre would be mobilized from the savings groups of all the villages within the network. An extra budget would be provided by outside partners such as the Community Organization Development Institute, a semi-governmental organization, and Action Aid, an international non-governmental organization (NGO). Meanwhile, the boat maintenance centre that would be a part of this compound would be constructed with the support from the South-South Grants Facility (SSGF). COMMUNIT Y-BASED BOAT All of the eight villages under the project were adversely affected by the tsunami of 26 December 2004, especially small-scale fishing households whose fishing boats were completely damaged (fig. 3). The only boat repair shop on the island was also wiped out and the bridge that connected the island with the mainland was destroyed. Subsequently, when the boat engines and their accessories were damaged, the villagers had to transport them across two narrow straits to shops on the mainland of Krabi or Trang Small Island…Smart Ideas: Thailand 95 Province. The trip usually took up to four hours and involved extra expenses such as for transportation, food and accommodation apart from the repair fee. Sometimes, the villagers had to stay on the mainland for a few days while waiting for the boats to be repaired so they lost both time and income during this period. The costs for travelling and accommodation often were much higher than the repair and maintenance costs. Therefore, the villagers unanimously agreed on the idea of having a community-based boat maintenance centre.",

    "abstract": "Under this project, a multi-purpose building for a coastal community was constructed to support the community’s self-initiated efforts in addressing economic and environmental issues that had persisted for many years. The tsunami opened new opportunities for the people to reiterate these problems and obtain due support for their initiatives. The project helped the people to pursue their efforts by providing necessary infrastructure and facilities as well as enhancing the capacity of the community to manage self-sustained development. It was implemented through communitybased organizations (CBOs) to ensure the community’s ownership and participation in the project. Its innovative approach to linking an infrastructure project with the community’s goal of sustainable livelihood and long-term environmental protection has been recognized and supported by high-level government authorities, the media, the private sector and its neighbouring communities. At the end of the project, a memorandum of understanding was jointly signed by all concerned parties to acknowledge and support the community’s initiatives in this regard. Baan (village) Thonglarng, a small village with 140 households and a population of around 2,000, is located in Lor Yoong Sub-district, Phang Nga Province. As in many other coastal communities in southern Thailand, the villagers have traditionally earned their living from smallscale fishing and Pará rubber plantations. During the past ten years, however, the community’s livelihoods and environment have been adversely affected by the economic policies that have promoted large-scale fisheries and export-oriented prawn farming in mangrove areas. Destructive fishing tools used by commercial fishing boats caused severe damage to the community’s coastal resources such as sea grass fields and coral reefs that are home to many aqua species. The community’s mangrove forest was also encroached on by private prawn farms whose waste water is drained into the community mangrove area and its connected waterway. The decline in food stock and natural resources has driven many young people to leave their village to find jobs in the city. Most of them are hired in service and industrial sectors and send remittances to their families. On 26 December 2004, the village was badly hit by the tsunami. Although no one was killed because the mangrove forest had protected the whole village from the huge waves, fishing boats and tools of many households were completely destroyed. Many young people lost their jobs in hotels, golf courses and tour companies. Several months after the crisis, it was still difficult for the villagers to resume their normal way of living as the amount of catch was still low. The Synergizing Livelihood and Environment: Thailand 105 fuel price, in conjunction with the low selling price of aqua species over a long period, made things worse. In such a time of crisis, the village Savings Group has proved to be a reliable source of assistance. The group was established in 2001 by a group of women and was the community’s first self-initiated development scheme. Before the tsunami, the group had been active in reducing financial burdens on the community members through its low-interest loans and welfare schemes. Shortly after the tsunami, it gave loans to the affected households, found jobs within the community and nearby villages for those who became unemployed, and took a proactive approach to protecting the community’s mangrove and coastal resources to secure long-term recovery of their production base. It supported the establishment of another CBO, Thonglarng Mangrove Protection Group, to work side by side with the Savings Group to rehabilitate the mangrove forest around the village (fig. 1). This would consequently increase aqua-species stock in the community’s coastal areas. The project, “The Construction of a Building for the Savings Group of Baan Thonglarng”, was another effort to enhance the community’s self-reliant development capacity. It was implemented during the period from September 2005 to August 2006 by the village Savings Group, with full support from the Mangrove Protection Group. It was expected that the project would create short-term employment opportunities in the village through construction work and long-term economic benefits through a community business to be implemented once the building had been completed.",

    "abstract": "This project aimed to provide 260 headload women fish vendors from three villages in Sirkazhi District with iceboxes to replace the aluminium or cane baskets that they had been using traditionally (fig. 1). The easy-carry iceboxes were a creative solution to a long-standing problem for the women, i.e., the shelf life of fish that they obtained, since they were to keep the fish fresh for more than a day as opposed to the traditional baskets. Designed to suit the women’s needs, the iceboxes helped to increase income through reduction in waste of fish purchased. They also reduced the dependency of the women on others for storage. To improve the mobility of the headload vendors (and their market coverage) as well as save them time for rest and being with their family, the project trained women in cycling, a mode of transportation that is still considered to be only for men. In order to ensure a level of sustainability, the women were organized into livelihood groups that formed a larger federation, and, as a unit, they created linkages with established institutions and organizations such as the Department of Fisheries to strengthen their livelihoods. The project attempted to increase the women’s bargaining power by assisting them to federate formally around issues. It also aimed to help them to know and access their rights and entitlements. These activities contributed to building the capacity of the headload women fish vendors to have a more sustainable livelihood. The provision of a loan would reduce the dependency on moneylenders as the rate of interest would be low and the women would have a long period within which to repay the money. At the time of writing of the case study report, however, these loans had not been made as the Human Development Welfare and Educational Trust had yet to receive the second phase of the grant. The tsunami of 26 December 2004 hit the coastal fishing and farming habitats on the southern coast of South India hard, leaving nearly 11,000 people dead1, hundreds of houses destroyed, and close to a thousand hectares of standing crops also destroyed as the water entered at least 3 km inland. It resulted in the loss of livelihoods for men and women in Figure 1 Women with the new iceboxes, a striking contrast to women with traditional cane baskets on their way to the market. 1 http://www.worldbank.org.in Freezing Livelihood Options for Women: India 121 Nagapattinam District, the worst-affected district in India in terms of death toll and scale of physical damage. Unprecedented humanitarian responses had been enabling the people of Nagapattinam to recover from the shock in a phased manner over the following two and a half years. Men and women whose physical assets had been lost or damaged, however hugely, benefited from the humanitarian response. Women fish vendors, agricultural labourers, tenants and migrated labourers, however, had received insignificant support to improve their livelihoods from the development opportunity that any major disaster response creates. Headload fish vendors are the women in fishing communities who purchase fish from the fishermen and sell them in their own and surrounding villages. They carry the fish in cane baskets on their heads and go door to door selling them. Many of these women also travel on foot to neighbouring villages to sell the fish if they are unable to sell all the fish for the day in their own village. By the end of the day, the fish begin rotting in the baskets and must be thrown away. Some of the major issues that women headload vendors face are dependency on moneylenders for credit, buying fish from second and third parties on credit, low income from the purchase of goodquality fish in a sufficient quantity, lack of facilities for the storage of fish bought in the evening and rapid decay of the fish while selling. On the social front, women experience exclusion and suffer from ill treatment by others in the communities. They work long hours in inhospitable weather conditions, compete with male counterparts who enjoy greater mobility and fight with the road transport operators for space to carry fish to markets.",

    "abstract": "Under the second phase of the SouthSouth Grants Facility (SSGF) projects in India, this project aimed at providing loans to the women as working capital to start income-generating activities. As of the writing of the case study report, 30 women had taken loans of 10,000 rupees each (approximately $250) and had reconstructed their lime kilns and started fish vending businesses, goat rearing and small food establishments. Training in palm leaf products and general entrepreneurship had been provided to 15 women while community-based training in disaster preparedness had yet to be conducted. A child care centre under construction will provide a space for the children (first-generation learners) to pursue their educational dreams and also provide training in life skills through a trained teacher from the community. A production and marketing unit will be set up to provide the women from Senthilveedhi1 and Madasamipuram with a space from which to sell their products, thus creating links to larger markets. A new addition to the project activities is the construction of a warehouse in the village, which will also act as a Lime Marketing Unit and will be run by the women from the self-help groups (SHGs). Another new activity that has been included in the project is the startup of a vessel rental unit in the village. After observing its work in the village, the Anawim Trust was approached by the men of the community to help them organize themselves into groups and start saving using credit schemes. Eight of the 18 coastal villages with which the Anawim Trust works were affected by the tsunami. Madasamipuram is one of them. Located about 15 km from the town of Tiruchendur, this village has a population of 320. The International Ocean Institute (IOI) and the Anawim Trust have been coordinating an eco-village project in about 60 coastal villages in this area since 1996. The present project aimed to concentrate on the development of women and children, simultaneously focusing on ecological interventions. 1 Senthilveedhi is another tsunami-affected Dalit village where the people lost their lime kilns in the tsunami. The organizations had finished working with this village prior to the project discussed in this case study. The Supply Chain Fifteen kilograms of sea shells are sold by the owners of the lime kiln to the middleman (an agent) for 40-50 rupees for poultry feed, which is further sold to the poultry farms at the rate of 75 rupees. Seashells are one of the ingredients mixed in poultry feed to enhance the calcium content. Each time the owners burn the kiln it costs them 900 rupees. The entire amount of lime that they obtain from this is sold for 1,200 rupees, giving them a profit of 300 rupees. The middleman sells it for 300 rupees at no cost to him at all. Madasamipuram is inhabited by a Dalit (untouchable) community. These people exist at the lowest echelon of the social and economic hierarchy and are the most vulnerable at all times and even more so during and after a disaster. The major livelihood in the village is the collection and processing of sea shells into lime by burning the shells in lime kilns, which are built along the coast. Women and children collect the shells from the coast and the men dive to the bottom of the ocean to collect them and pile them on the beach  (fig. 1). Most of the collecting used to be done from November to January,  at which point heaps of shells would line the beach. Once the collecting is finished, the people burn the shells in the kilns to produce lime (fig. 2). The alternative livelihoods for these people were harvesting crabs and lobsters and collecting large conches from the sea bed to be sold as ornamental products. Though the houses of these people are a safe distance from the sea, their livelihoods are carried on at the beach. The tsunami not only wiped out their catch of shells but also destroyed the lime kilns, their only major source of income. In the post-tsunami period, the availability of shells has decreased even during the peak period from November to January; over the two years, the people noticed a sharp decline in the amount of sea shells that they collected during these months. The tsunami exposed the vulnerability of this community in terms of its complete dependence on the sea for its own survival. The Anawim Trust and IOI had previously worked successfully in the village of Senthilveedhi with the Dalit community not only in rebuilding the lime kilns but also providing the women with alternative livelihoods and setting up a child care centre and a production centre. The problem in Madasamipuram was that the women were not trained in or aware of alternative livelihood options nor did they have the financial backing to be entrepreneurs. This raised the question of how and where they would market their product. Even in their traditional livelihoods, they were dependent on an agent or a middleman who The Women of the Sea: India 133 Figure 2 Lime kilns on the beach. Next to the kilns are piles of coal that are used to burn the shells. Figure 1 Women and men collecting shells from the sea and dumping them in mounds on the beach. The men collect shells by diving into the deep sea. bought the lime from them and then sold it to construction companies or other outlets at much higher prices. Furthermore, the women not only actively participated in the shell collection but they also had to take care of the household. They were the most responsive to the programmes conducted by the Anawim Trust. Three SHGs existed in the village and these were selected to be the primary beneficiaries of the project. Children in this Dalit community were first-generation learners and needed support to continue their education or else they would drop out of school. Many of them had a difficult time gaining entrance into schools or staying there once they were enrolled. Many of them, said Ms. Shanti, Director of the Anawim Trust, dropped out because they felt ostracized or needed to help the family earn money to help it survive. A child care centre would provide them with a space where they could do their homework after school and take extra classes in any subject as well as special classes in English and mathematics. Children from three to 14 years of age would be supported through this centre.",

    "abstract": "The Community Development Organization Trust (C-DOT) took up the rehabilitation of the village of Thiruvanmiyur Kuppam in the southern District of Chennai in Tamil Nadu (fig. 1). The project is the first activity undertaken as the starting point for longterm rehabilitation. C-DOT has established 25 women self-help groups (SHGs) in the village since December 2006. The women of the village are members and each SHG has a membership of 17 to 20 women. C-DOT also set up training programmes for the women in leadership, capacity-building, life skills communication, marketing, administration, financial planning and management, pickle-making and fish processing. The SHGs were also taken on an exposure visit to the Thoothukudi Fisheries Department and experts from this department trained the women in fish processing. The SHGs formed a federation known as the Thiruvanmiyur Kuppam Women’s Federation, with a formal structure comprising a president, a secretary, a treasurer and two representatives from each SHG. With funds from C-DOT, local real estate agents and money contributed from the SHGs, an export-oriented fishprocessing unit was being constructed at the time of writing of the  case study report. The SHGs had employed a contractor to complete the work (fig. 2), and the SHG Federation leader, Kalayavani, with the support of the other members, was overseeing it. The construction work was expected to be completed at the end of August 2007. The land had been given to the Federation by the village. Surrounding land that was owned by the Housing Board and a scrap metal shop, which was next to the construction site, was also to be given for expanding the factory. The scrap metal shop was being shifted to another location in the village. The SHGs had contributed a total of 125,000 rupees from their savings (5,000 rupees from each SHG). Up to August 2007, each SHG had managed to save up to approximately 30,000 rupees. Figure 1 The village of Thiruvanmiyur Kuppam. Figure 2 Inside the factory unit under construction, the SHG Federation leaders and C-DOT staff carry on a discussion with the contractors. Enhancing Capacities, Increasing Confidence: India 143 With the training over, the women were impatiently waiting for the factory unit to be started. Chinnapenn, a 60year-old lady who was the secretary to the Federation, said, “We cannot wait for the factory to begin functioning. We have worked so hard and it has been a long time since we all earned a decent living without worrying about how we’ll get through another day.” The Slum Clearance Board of Chennai gave the SHGs a grant of 750,000 rupees and each SHG received a revolving fund of 30,000 rupees, which are given as loans to members who need the money. Within two months, 18 women had availed themselves of the loans and had started small fish-vending businesses and sari and other small shops. With the support and help of CARE India, boats, nets and engines were distributed to the men of the community. All the boats have been registered in the wife’s name. Life-skills training in issues such as addiction prevention, prevention of risky behaviour, risk management, decisionmaking, self-awareness, stress management and emotional management was conducted for 43 young men in the village. Thiruvanmiyur Kuppam is a village located in the southern part of the District of Chennai. The coastal stretch is about three to four kilometres and there are six to seven fishing hamlets. The first wave of the tsunami wiped out the thatchedroof kachcha houses. Being a Sunday, most of the villagers were at the larger market, which is further inland; thus there were no casualties in the village. The village is not far away from the city limits, yet it was one of the last to receive help. With the intervention of the District Collectorate, the village was taken up by C-DOT in 2006. Apart from initial relief with the help of Nehru Yuva Kendra volunteers, the villagers were completely overlooked. The men stopped fishing activities for a year owing to fear of returning to the sea or lack of money to buy boats and it was left to the women to ensure that the family was fed and taken care of. This put a huge strain on the women. The government compensation of 5,000 rupees was given to the men and those who owned boats received an additional 15,000 rupees. This money rarely came to the family. To the men’s dismay, when they took up fishing again, the catch was paltry and did not suffice for food for the house and for selling. The widows were also given compensation but this was not adequate to take care of their families. To sustain themselves, many women had to take loans from moneylenders to buy fish from the larger market in Koyembedu and sell it in the village. With no transport or money, they would walk to the market five kilometres away and back. Most of the time, the loans could not be repaid because they were not making much of a profit; therefore, they were stuck in a cycle of borrowing and lending. An alternative form of livelihood was necessary to ensure that the families could sustain themselves throughout the year without completely depending on fishing to bring in an income. Increasing alcoholism and gambling among the men had been noticed and the young men were also becoming caught in the same vices.",

    "abstract": "This project, implemented by Rifka Annisa, addressed the urgent economic and social needs of the earthquake-affected community of Krapyak Wetan by renovating the local tenun (traditional hand-woven cloth) factory and creating, training and marketing a village-based women’s handicraft collective (fig. 1). The project is of significant cultural and social importance as it offers an effective model for empowering village women while assisting in the rejuvenation of an important traditional handicraft on the brink of its demise. The earthquake that measured 6.5 on the Richter scale brought down large sections of the Lestari Kurnia factory, the collapsing roofs destroying the fragile looms beneath them (fig. 2). Within the short space of a minute, Lestari Kurnia went from being an aging but wellrespected traditional handicrafts business, teetering on the brink of viability owing to diminishing markets, to a ruined enterprise without access to the capital required. Without intervention, Lestari Kurnia’s mostly elderly employees had little or no chance of finding alternative employment. The post-earthquake loss of both livelihoods and houses left many poorer families both psychologically traumatized and financially shattered. This had a particularly harsh impact on village women, facing increased levels of depression and domestic violence, with no clear path forward. With very few members of the younger generation expressing interest in the traditional handicrafts, the tenun lurik industry faced a grim future prior to the earthquake, which was subsequently made much grimmer (fig. 3).

    "abstract": "The peninsula of Ujong Muloh is encircled by the India Ocean, the  Lambeusoi River and a small range of hills. This exposed topography means that Ujong Muloh was one of the areas most harshly affected by the 2004 tsunami. It suffered unimaginable loss, with less than 760 people left alive from the original 1,580 inhabitants and all buildings destroyed. Villagers now live in temporary shelters built on a football field behind the village’s foothills more than 200 metres from the old site. This field is located beside the former highway from Banda Aceh to Calang in an area now bypassed as the Lambeusoi Bridge was destroyed. Through living full-time and working for over two years within the community of Ujong Muloh, Sokola, a small local NGO, assisted the community in analysing its livelihood and training needs and in seeking funding to address those needs. Through this process, the community identified that the majority of livelihood programmes in the area such as reconstruction and boat building had, in effect, been targeted at men. The 2004 tsunami had shattered most of the small enterprises in Ujong Muloh, including two small sewing and embroidery businesses that, according to survivors, had been both busy and profitable. Before the tsunami, the seamstresses of Ujong Muloh had been known throughout the neighbouring villages for the quality of their products. Sadly, the women who had run these businesses died during the tsunami and none of the surviving women possessed the handicraft skills to fill the gap that they left behind. The loss of this small industry was overlooked by large NGOs, which in their rush to rebuild tended to provide aid in the form of boats, agricultural equipment, fish nets, etc., inadvertently supporting men and overlooking the important economic role of women in the community. Torn by armed conflict and the tsunami, the women and children were excited by the concept of a reading centre for the children. Later on, the women were interested in learning sewing and embroidery skills. The women of Ujong Muloh mentioned that they would be happy to be able to sew for themselves and to earn some income from these activities. Sokola has been involved with the tsunami-affected communities of Ujong Muloh, Kuala and Teumareum since April 2005. Using its experience in working with vulnerable children of minority groups, Sokola volunteers live full time in the village, where they have worked with the community to develop a children’s centre along with life skills and microeconomy training programmes. Through the development of alternative business opportunities, the project assisted one of the most severely affected communities in its struggle to regain control of its livelihoods and overcome growing aid dependency. It also provided an opportunity for survivors to develop their coping mechanism as tsunami and armed-conflict survivors. The project supported the grass-roots work of a small Window to Opportunities: Indonesia 167 NGO, creating valuable training resources that it could use again in other postdisaster environments. Owing to its location on a small peninsula, the village of Ujong Muloh was particularly hard hit, with over half of the residents killed and almost all infrastructure destroyed. The slow progress in reconstruction meant that more than two years after the tsunami, the majority of the population continued to live in substandard, temporary accommodation. With almost total damage to livelihood infrastructure, many residents remained dependent on aid for their survival. A local Indonesian NGO named Sokola applied for South-South Grants Facility (SSGF) funding for a children’s education centre and for upgrading the centre for wider use for youth and parents. The women chose to run a livelihood project based on sewing and embroidery. Although this had been one of the economic activities of the village prior to the tsunami, the community’s seamstresses had died and their skills had been lost.",

The community cybercafé, which had been the one source of Internet access on the island prior to its destruction by the 2004 tsunami, was re-established under the project and with faster Internet access using broadband via satellite (fig. 1). In addition, direct Internet service was provided to households and other entities at affordable prices through a cable network. The use of the network was later extended for the provision of cable television services as well. Since the start of the project, the Hinnavaru community has been much more conversant with Internet usage. Students, teachers, parents, office workers and others now use the Internet for school projects, to obtain general information, and for e-mail, trade and various other purposes (fig. 2. Furthermore, the community has also benefited from lower prices for the cable television service as the monopoly that had previously existed in the sector was challenged. As a result, the Hesperus Sports Club’s objective of “building back better” was achieved. Hinnavaru is an island of the Lhaviyani Atoll of the Maldives located 146.61 km from the capital city, Male’. The island covers an area of 7.24 hectares and hosts a population of 4,355, of which 1,600 are under 18 years of age. Fishing, masonry and carpentry comprise the main economic activities of the island community. Advanced telecommunication facilities had not yet been widely extended to many islands of the Maldives.

    "abstract": "As a result of the 2004 tsunami, 70 per cent of the population had been displaced and 48 households were homeless. Under the second phase of the South-South Grants Facility (SSGF) Programme in the Maldives, this project supported the creation of income-generating opportunities for youth and women of Fonadhoo, Laamu Atoll, by facilitating training in handicraft production and in computer skills. The project was implemented by a newly formed, local non-governmental organization (NGO), WomenEnhancement, which collaborated with another non-profit organization, the Creative Arts and Crafts Training Centre (CACTC), to train people from the community to produce traditional and new types of arts and crafts from local materials by using modern technology and tools. At the time of writing of the case study report, Women Enhancement also was organizing computer literacy training for later in the year, which would use equipment procured under the project. As a result of the first round of handicraft training, 27 people in the community have the potential to earn an income from the production of good-quality arts and crafts using local inputs. Their potential has been recognized by CACTC, UNDP and the national Women’s Entrepreneurship Council (WEC). CACTC has expressed an interest in purchasing the community’s products for retailing through its outlet in Male’, UNDP is encouraging other islands in the region to use the trainees as instructors, and WEC extended an invitation to Women Enhancement to participate in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Trade Fair held in Colombo in July 2007. The executives of this young, women-led NGO have become more empowered and assured in their ability to make a difference, the community has lent its support to this organization, and a new confidence in their own abilities has been engendered among the people of Fonadhoo. The island of Fonadhoo is part of the mainland of Laamu Atoll that encompasses four islands linked by causeways. One of many islands affected, the 2004 tsunami left 70 per cent of the population displaced and 48 households homeless. The Laamu region, with the availability of space and serviced by a regional airport accessible by road from the three large islands, has been targeted for development as one of the regional growth nodes of the country. A large fish-processing plant had very recently been established in the atoll, and islands had been earmarked for tourist resort development in the region. However, a large proportion of the Fonadhoo population of 1,764 (47 per cent of whom are women) was unemployed or underemployed and lacked the skills and/or capacity to be Crafts and Computer Skills: Maldives 187 gainfully employed in many sectors. The introduction of tourism into the region could open up opportunities for significant improvement in the livelihoods and living standards of the community if the right skills were developed and used among the labour force. Given that the demand for local handicrafts that fit varying budgets would only increase as tourism expanded, there had been much debate about the viability of the handicrafts industry as one that could offer attractive remuneration to people with the requisite skills. Maldivian handicrafts had traditionally been expensive, owing largely to inefficient and time-consuming methods of production that used traditional tools and hence appealed only to those who were willing to pay the premium for locally made goods. As a result, a large number of the souvenirs that tourists took back from the Maldives were, in fact, inexpensive imports from Southeast Asia. Over the past few years, however, a local NGO, CACTC, had been training youth to use modern equipment and tools for woodturning and wood curving, lacquer work, pyrography and other creative craftwork, which increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Despite this, there was still a dearth of people skilled in making handicrafts, and with a national unemployment rate of 14 per cent in 2006, there was much room for the absorption of creative people into the sector. In terms of computer literacy, while an explosion of training opportunities in various aspects of information technology had been witnessed in the country, this had largely been limited to the capital region. Even though the larger secondary schools at the island level were equipped with computer laboratories, such schools existed only on a few islands, and there also were not many opportunities for non-students to be trained even on those islands. This had resulted in many people without the computer literacy needed to obtain gainful employment in today’s world.",

    "abstract": "With the two grants obtained from the South-South Grants Facility (SSGF), the Foundation for Rural Community Development (FRCD), an NGO, worked for 20 months with 100 community members in the tsunami-affected village of Beligalagoda to improve their livelihood activities. During phase one, the NGO formed three community-based organizations (CBOs) and empowered the 38 beneficiaries through training as well as grants and loans from the credit scheme. These men and women were in occupations such as tailoring, the coir fibre industry, the making of clay bricks and the cultivation of supplementary food crops. For sustainability of the livelihoods, separate revolving funds were established for each of the CBOs, whose members obtain small loans, repayable in monthly instalments, with interest calculated on the reducing balance. The revolving-fund scheme has empowered the communities, particularly the women. With the assistance of the community and the second loan obtained from the SSGF, FRCD is constructing a multipurpose community centre. The centre will be used as a paddy distribution outlet and for producing and selling compost manure.  It also will promote the sale of products of the beneficiaries from phase 1. The villagers are thankful to FRCD for not abandoning them like many other donor-funded projects, whose modus operandi is a “quick fix”, which is not sustainable in a livelihood recovery programme. Apart from financing and goods, continuous moral support through being with the villagers so that they do not feel isolated is vital for success.

Table 1 Summary of Project Information. Waves of Hope after the Disaster: Sri Lanka 197 km from the capital, Colombo, in the Thawaluwila Grama Niladari (GNS) Division in Hambantota District, this village was severely affected by the tsunami waves in December 2004. The District was one of the underdeveloped areas, and over 33 per cent of the community were State welfare recipients (i.e., people earning less than $15 per month). The main livelihood of this village community was rice farming. After the tsunami, however, many farmers switched to alternate crops or were involved in other forms of livelihood; rice farming was no longer considered a profitable occupation. A few weeks after the tsunami, FRCD visited the Hambantota District to assess the impact of the deadly waves on the area with the intention of helping people to overcome their losses and begin their livelihood activities. It was directed to Beligalagoda (fig. 1), where livelihoods had been badly affected by the disaster. The village is located in the vicinity of the mouth of the Walawe River; therefore, water from both the sea and the river hit the village, destroying human lives and infrastructure. Eleven people lost their lives: one person perished in the village while the remaining 10 died in the nearby market. Twenty-six houses were totally destroyed and many more were partially damaged. A field survey conducted by FRCD with the help of the village officer (Grama Seva Niladari) indicated that in the Thawaluwila GS Division, the livelihoods are varied, with the main economic activities being fishing, agriculture, and trade and services. In Beligalagoda, the selected village, people are mainly vendors whose work is associated with several nearby markets or they are wage labourers or paddy farmers (fig. 2). The farmers suffered owing to low productivity as their paddy land was salinated by the sea water that had come inland during the tsunami. As paddy farming had ceased to be a lucrative trade, most of the farmers were involved in supplementary livelihood activities such as brick making and the cultivation of vegetable and fruit crops to earn extra money. Although there was a high demand for supplementary agricultural products in the market, these, too, Figure 1 Location of the study site. Figure 2 Recorded livelihood activities in the village of Beligalagoda. had been affected by the tsunami. The fishermen who lived near the river mouth were the worst affected and many left the village as they received new land from the Government. At the time, 51 per cent of the population in this village was female. The women were involved in multiple activities such as tailoring, the making of coir rope and other small-scale businesses to help supplement their family income. The survey also indicated that despite the outpouring of relief such as shelter, food and clothing in the wake of the tsunami, many of the donors lacked the capacity to implement long-term activities such as livelihood improvement. In this regard, the donor focus was mainly on the fishery sector, while assistance for upgrading smallholder businesses such as brick making, the coir fibre industry, pottery, tailoring and the planting of additional food crops received very little attention. The main objective of the FRCD proposal to the SSGF was to use the grant to upgrade the village community in Beligalagoda by assisting in the re-establishment of sustainable livelihoods that had been destroyed or damaged by the tsunami. Initially, the NGO received $8,000 and, one year later, $18,203 under the second phase to carry its work forward and to expand its activities in order to assist the village community to overcome a few more challenges for a better tomorrow.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this project was to upgrade an existing office of the village savings group and to construct new houses for poor families in the community. The upgraded building would have a broader function, i.e., a centre for savings and for the community’s self-initiated economic, social and environmental activities. The project was implemented by a home-grown community-based organization (CBO), the Baan Ao Kung Savings Group, led by a group of women who took a big challenge by stepping out of their traditional home-confined roles. An inter-village network of savings groups established for mutual assistance also helped to boost the success of the project. The project was seen as a continuation of the community’s self-help initiatives. It built upon and further enhanced the capacity of the community’s social infrastructure, i.e., a community savings group, to carry on development activities for longer-term benefits. Baan Ao Kung, a small fishing village with 70 households, is located on the Andaman coast. Most of the villagers do not have their own land and build their houses in the national park area because most of the land around the village belongs to private investors from town that invest in pará rubber plantations and hire local villagers to work for them. Fishing households in the village still use traditional fishing methods and tools that are environmentally friendly. Usually, they sell their fresh fish and seafood (fig. 1) through middlemen while some is preserved for home consumption. Almost every household has occasional supplementary income from working on a rubber plantation or golf course or in a hotel or tourism-related services. In the past, most households were indebted to either official banks or private landlords who charged a monthly interest rate of 20 per cent. The villagers also had to put their assets such as motorcycles and fishing boats up as collateral. In 1996, a group of women went on a study tour to a savings group in a nearby province. This group, seeing that the community’s savings were the only means by which to release itself from high-interest debts, introduced the concept to other villagers after returning to their villages. Eventually, the Baan Ao Kung Savings Group was established on 6 February 1996 to serve as a small-scale, community-based financial institute. It Figure 1 Fresh seafood, the main source of the villagers’ income. In the Women’s Hands: Thailand 209 began by selling shares to all households at the price of 20 baht per share and was able to mobilize up to 3,000 baht at the start. Also in the beginning, both men and women were committee members of the Savings Group. After one year, however, women were elected to replace men because of their proven ability in financial management and their dedication. Over 10 years, the Baan Ao Kung Savings Group has made significant progress in many ways. It was able to buy a piece of public land and build a onestorey building, which has been used as the Savings Group’s office and community meeting centre. The amount of savings had accumulated to 500,000 baht by August 2007. Through low-interest loans from the Savings Group, i.e., 2 per cent per month, almost every household was able to pay back its debts to private landlords. The profits from the loan are given back as dividends to Savings Group members and allocated to five different community funds, as illustrated in table 1. Despite the efforts at self-help and the progress made by its Savings Group, the community is still facing a threatening situation caused by foreign investors who want to build an international yacht landing port near the village, a project that will inevitably damage coastal resources and the villagers’ fishing gear. Rapid expansion of the tourism business also resulted in encroachment on the community public mangrove forest and damage to the sea grass and coral reefs that are inhabited by coastal species. The villagers therefore need to have better knowledge and strategies to deal with these threats. Although these women leaders have demonstrated their ability in financial management, they still have a limited Type of Allocation/Fund % of Profit Purpose Allocated Dividends to members 40 Profits to go back to Group members based on the mutually agreed rules.

Being Muslim women, their traditional roles are defined within religious and cultural codes of conduct. On the other hand, as leaders of a core CBO, they are also expected to take a lead in managing emerging issues such as those already mentioned. The project, “The Construction of a Building for the Baan Ao Kung Savings Group,” was seen as one potential opportunity for women leaders of the community to increase their management capacity through a new challenge and to expand their connection with outside sources of knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The project aimed to construct a multipurpose building to support community development activities in three areas: alternative livelihoods through community business, financial security through savings and welfare schemes, and sustainable management of natural resources. It was implemented through a communitybased organization (CBO), with additional support from an inter-village network that helped to leverage the impact of the project’s activities through knowledge-sharing and policy dialogue. This project is an exemplary case of how the South-South cooperation principles are applied at the village level among marginalized communities with remarkable impact, which goes beyond economic benefits. Phuket is a small island but it has been a well-known tourist destination for a long time. The western side of the island is crowded with tourists, hotels, restaurants and all kinds of tourist-attraction activities. The eastern side, which is only a 15-minute drive from the western side, is the opposite. The villagers still maintain a traditional way of living and are engaged primarily in coastal fishery. Baan Bangla, a small village situated about 20 kilometres east of the Phuket provincial town, is no different. The 139 households earn their living from aquaculture, coastal fishing and smallscale pará rubber plantations.  During the past 10 years, however, there has been a rapid expansion of housing projects for urban middle-class people into this local area. The villagers were worried that their natural environment and harmonious way of life would be affected. They have also been fighting with respect to community land issues for more than a decade to resist illegal claims on their public land by private investors. The last piece of public land where the old savings group building is located is connected to a community mangrove forest that is well protected by the villagers. In 1999, the village savings group was established to serve as a community financial institute. According to Arun Bamroongna, head of the Baan Bangla Savings Group, the Group takes deposits from its members on a regular, monthly basis and provides loans at a 2 per cent interest rate per month to its members, who invest the money in their production activities. Some set up a small trading business and many invest in aquaculture. They raise fish and shells in cages in the canal, which is connected to the sea. The Baan Bangla Savings Group has constantly grown. Its membership expanded from 36 to 86 households and the savings rose from 350,000 baht before the tsunami to 760,000 baht only one and a half years after the disaster (Source: September 2007 report, Baan Bangla Savings Group). More than the Sum of Their Parts: Thailand 219 After the tsunami, the role of the Savings Group became more relevant. It provided interest-free loans to 36 households that had lost their fishing boats and tools and to the village women’s group, which also had lost its handicraft products in several souvenir shops along the Patong beach. With such a loan, the women’s group was able to restart its business. It made crystal necklaces, earrings, pins, rings, etc., which are very popular with Muslim women in Phuket and nearby provinces. The old building of the Baan Bangla Savings Group was a temporary oneroom structure, built with the primary objective of marking the community’s ownership over its last piece of public land near the community’s mangrove forest. As the Group grew and the issue of outsiders’ encroachment on the community’s land became more and more crucial, the villagers wanted to have a more permanent and well-equipped building to use as an operation centre for their savings and to pursue their long-term development objectives.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this project was to strengthen the ongoing, self-initiated efforts of poor fishing communities to protect their natural resource base and secure their livelihoods through a proactive approach involving both on-the-ground activities and high-level policy negotiation. A long-term community master plan is in place, with the objective of achieving sustainable development results in three areas: protection of coastal resources, mangrove management and development of human capital. The project created a new livelihood opportunity for the communities by constructing and establishing a communitybased cooperative shop. Once the construction is finished, the shop will be owned and managed by the communities, which will learn new entrepreneurial skills through real-time activities. Fishing households will buy their fishing gear and goods for daily consumption at much lower prices, and part of the profits from the shop will be used to implement activities under the community master plan to achieve the community’s long-term development goal. Baan Tha Klang is located on the Andaman Sea coast in Ranong Province. It has 130 households and a population of around 700. Situated between a national park and the Thailand-Myanmar trans boundary sea, the villagers of Baan Tha Klang and a few neighbouring villages have limited access to farmland and can fish only in a limited coastal zone. Most villagers are small-scale fishermen who still use traditional fishing gear, which is more environmentally friendly (fig. 1). During the past 20 years, however, there has been an increasing use of destructive fishing tools by large-scale fishing boats for export-oriented purposes. As they were refrained from entering the Myanmar sea zone, these commercial fishing boats moved closer to the narrow coastal areas, resulting in a sharp decline in coastal resources; many aqua species were damaged by destructive fishing tools. The livelihood of small-scale fishing households was adversely affected as their income relied heavily on coastal natural resources. It was estimated that before 1996, almost every fishing household in Baan Tha Klang and its neighbouring villages had been indebted for approximately 40,000-60,000 baht per household. Many of these households had sold their boats and fishing gear and had gone to sell their labour in town. Figure 1 Baan Tha Klang fisherfolk at their work. Linking Mid-term Rehabilitation to Long-term Sustainability : Thailand 229 In 1996, a small number of fisherfolk from Baan Tha Klang and nearby villages organized themselves into the Baan Tha Klang Fisherfolk Network. The primary objective of the Network was to protect their coastal natural resources, and several activities have been implemented since then. For example, speedboats were sent around coastal areas to keep a watch on big fishing boats with destructive fishing practices and notify the police. When commercial fishing boats proposed, through a Member of Parliament, to change the restricted fishing zone for big boats from 3,000 to 1,000 metres offshore, the Network was successful in engaging the Provincial Fishery Authority to stand on its side and reject the proposal. In addition to coastal protection, the Network also kept a watch on its mangrove forest and coordinated with the official authority when official logging was found. It also trained women and youth groups in livelihood activities that are non-threatening to the environment. A master plan was formulated to guide the direction of long-term development of the fishing communities in the area. The tsunami of December 2004 caused severe damage to Baan Tha Klang and several villages in the Network. One hundred fifty-one people were killed, 100 houses were washed away and more than 400 fishing boats were damaged. The Network coordinated with various donors for immediate relief. However, when it came to longer-term rehabilitation, assistance from these donors seemed to be insufficient and not effectively planned. Most of the assistance from outside did not build on the community’s existing mechanisms nor did it involve the community in the design and planning process. As a result, many affected households could not fully benefit from the assistance while some activities could not be sustained in the longer run because they were implemented with no genuine community participation. The plan to build a community cooperative shop was an exception, however. The decision was taken through a consultative process with all households and was facilitated by the Baan Tha Klang Fisherfolk Network, which is a homegrown community-based organization (CBO). The community realized that the co-op shop would be beneficial to it in both the shorter and longer terms. One year after the tsunami, coastal resources had gradually recovered and the villagers were ready to go back to the sea. They needed new fishing boats and fishing gear. Besides, the benefit from the shop would enable them to pursue their activities under the master plan to achieve their long-term goals.",

The individuals and SHGs were carefully selected from 10 villages where Madhar Nala Thondu Niruvanam (MNTN) had been working. The criterion for selection was people below the poverty line. Five small shops were set up: a tailoring shop, a flower shop, one dry fish shop and two teashops. The four SHGs (including one men’s SHG) received the grant for starting a utensil renting shop in the village of Koothapakkam, a mini canteen operated at the Cuddalore bus stand by women from KN Pettai, a cattle feed shop at Gunduplawaadi and a centring materials shop in Patharikuppam. There are 52 tsunami-affected villages in Cuddalore and the district administration announced that the whole district had been affected by the tsunami. Madhar Nala Thondu Niruvanam (MNTN) had been working in all the affected villages for the past 25 years setting up women’s SHGs. Not only were the fishermen’s livelihoods lost but there also was a loss to agriculture and other fishing-related livelihoods. Already poor, vulnerable and severely affected, communities were facing very high unemployment. In Cuddalore, the affected people were divided into two main categories: primary and secondary affected groups. The primary affected were those whose houses and livelihoods had been completely destroyed and whose village had also had a loss of lives. The secondary affected were those who had not necessarily lost their homes but who were dependent on the fishermen to sustain their livelihoods, e.g., fish vendors and sellers of dry fish and salt fish. The beneficiaries of this livelihood project came under both categories.",

    "abstract": "The coastal communities of Samatiga were particularly hard hit by the December 2004 tsunami and earthquake. A series of 10- to 30-metre-high waves swamped these low-lying coastal communities, killing the bulk of the population and destroying everything in their path. Large segments of land were permanently lost to the sea, leaving one community an island and others permanently under water. Practically all boats, stock, houses and crops were swept away. The force of the tsunami obliterated the coastal highway of west Aceh, not only disconnecting these communities from the provincial capital of Banda Aceh but also wiping out the road to nearby Meulaboh, the capital of West Aceh District. Access remained difficult, with little in the way of through traffic or public transport. Isolated villages in the restricted military zone of Aceh received very little assistance in the first few weeks, with survivors carrying out the wounded by foot. When aid did arrive, it came in a rush. The global flood of donations placed pressure on agencies to disperse large quantities of funds as fast as possible. This rush to assist was often left little time or space for community participation or sustainable development, commonly resulting in inefficient and often poorly coordinated or implemented aid projects. International aid agencies in Samatiga included the Aceh Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency, the AustraliaIndonesia Partnership for Reconstruction and Development (AIPRD), Catholic Relief Services, Habitat for Humanity, Islamic Relief, Mercy Corp, Oxfam GB, Samaritan’s Purse, Save the Children, SOS Desa Taruna, the Spanish Red Cross, the Tearfund, UNDP, World Vision and Yayasan Tanggul Bencana. The Global Environment Facility Small Grants programme (GEF SGP) Indonesia coordinated funding from the South-South Grants Facility (SSGF) to fill in gaps through strategic intervention. To respond to the need for posttsunami livelihood empowerment following the disaster in December 2004, Yayasan Pengembangan Kawasan (YPK) provided mentorship and community organizing activities to tsunami-affected villages along the coastline of the Samatiga Sub-district of Aceh. The main outcomes of the activities are the establishment of Community Economic Development Centres (CEDCs) in five villages in Samatiga (fig. 1). These CEDCs were replicated from the pioneering efforts of the two CEDCs in two other villages in Samatiga. Each CEDC provides a focal point for the respective community, facilitating and promoting economic and sustainable development activities. Through capacity-building and skills transfer, CEDCs encourage villagers to This rush to assist was often left little time or space for community participation or sus tainable development, commonly resulting in inefficient and often poorly coordinated or implemented aid projects Community One-door Policy: Indonesia 251 become actively involved in the posttsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction of their village. Centre activities are based on the needs and potential of the organization and the communities, including organizational and development training sessions, income recovery schemes and village re-greening projects. CEDCs also assist the community to negotiate with donors as well as running a small community-managed microfinance facility. CEDCs provide communities with a strategic space for regaining control of their local development. The dynamic between YPK and the CEDC provides a picture for a community transitioning to a democracy with clear social contracts and measurable commitments. This process begins with community meetings to map the former and now existing village, documenting the natural and the built environment. Future community needs are then added, including current and planned development projects and transport, health, government and religious infrastructure. Disaster-preparedness and environmental-management strategies are also included. With this community planning process as a basis, communities then assess possibilities and capacities for urban and rural development, looking at available opportunities and the challenges that they may face. At community meetings, ideas for economic development and rehabilitation of damaged businesses and landscape are discussed and developed. With the guidance of YPK, CEDCs are managed by community-elected committees, ensuring village-level ownership and management as well as improving the skills and capacity of the community. Proposals that are developed by the community either are supported by the CEDC in efforts to seek funds from major donors or an application may be made to each CEDC microfinance facility for support. Each CEDC has a small pool of funds that is used by a revolving microfinance facility. Community management ensures that funds are well targeted, projects are well implemented and funds are repaid for use by future projects. The creation of CEDCs directly addresses the sense of disempowerment that had developed in many Acehnese communities, providing villagers with a new sense of access and control over their own economic development and rehabilitation. The tsunami and earthquake of December 2004 caused incalculable suffering, killing over 130,000 Acehnese and leaving more than 100,000 families both traumatized and homeless. For over 200 km, coastal Figure 1 Samatiga Community Economic Development Centres (CEDCs). communities were forced to recommence from a position well below zero. Gampong Cot, Gampong Teungoh, Lhok Bubon, Pucok Lueng, Suak Pandan, Suak Panteubreuh and Suak Seukee are seven out of the 13 villages in the West Ache Sub-district of Samatiga that suffered the most owing to the 2004 tsunami. These small coastal communities were completely devastated. Aside from the high rates of death and injury in coastal communities, plantations and farms were destroyed and all the infrastructure was turned to rubble (fig. 2). Village livelihood activities prior to the tsunami, such as fishing, agriculture, home industries and small-scale businesses, were crippled. The urgent need to improve the living conditions of the people in these villages has focused on how the people could uplift their lives, rebuilding their settlement and creating sustainable and environmentally sound livelihoods beyond the tsunami-funding context. Civil society has made more clamouring calls to assist the Acehnese – comprising mainly the tsunami survivors, ex-combatants and survivors of armed conflict – to look for options and take good decisions towards recovery and an integrated life in a peaceful period post-Helsinki Peace Accord 2005. The elected government has also called for more sustainable and integrated planning in the rehabilitation of life and the environment. Donor agencies will be leaving Aceh in 2009, with many of the large donor agencies already phased out in 2007. The Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD) and Nias will be phasing out in 2009. There is a looming question concerning sustainability and self-reliance principles that needs to be answered. Through its involvement, Yayasan Pengembangan Kawasan (YPK) became aware of the poor coordination and lack of sustainability in many donor-driven community development projects. Large NGOs with their own agendas have paid little heed to the needs and vision of the local residents. The measures of efficiency and effectiveness of funding delivery constituted the main reason to speed up the process of infrastructure development. Social infrastructure, however, was viewed as a high transaction cost and was usually perceived as unappealing in the counts of return of investment revenue. For the past three years, YPK has passed the test of being true to its purpose of social and economic reforms through volatile social dynamics in the villages. As a support system of theFigure 2 Devastated farms, plantations and environment. Community One-door Policy: Indonesia 253 CEDC, it actively advocates the replication of the community-based approach, sustainability and self-reliance principles when presenting its work and conducting dialogues with international organizations that have significant influence on tsunami rehabilitation projects in Aceh. These include Catholic Relief Services (CRS), the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF), Oxfam, the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency for NAD and Nias (BRR NADNias) and UNDP.",

    "abstract": "The South-South Grants Facility (SSGF) supported the strengthening and development of the agricultural sector on the island of Kaashidhoo in Kaafu Atoll of the Maldives. The tsunami of December 2004 had decimated many of the plots, making it difficult for farmers, 75 per cent of whom were women, to cultivate the land without a significant investment. Although agriculture had been a key income-generating activity on the island of Kaashidhoo, the necessary supplies were not available locally and had to be obtained from off the island, mostly from the capital island, Male’. This made the sector inefficient and costly for individual farmers. The local NGO, Kaafu Atoll Madharusaa Isdharivarunge FANAARU (FANAARU), developed a project to establish a shop that would enable a constant supply of agricultural supplies on the island and, hence, low price volatility. A shop was built, together with a storage facility, and the key supplies needed by farmers were made available for sale in the shop. The varieties procured for resale were identified in consultation with the farmer community and procured through distributors on Male’. A facility was later established in order for needy farmers to obtain goods from the shop on credit. A flexible period during which to pay for the items based on the crop/business cycle of each farmer was provided, with a ceiling on credit of 5,000 rufiyaa (Rf) and full repayment required prior to a new credit extension. In early 2007, the goods from the shop were also retailed through a general store owned by a member of FANAARU. This made it possible to save on the operational costs of running the outlet by limiting the hours that the shop had to stay open. This project addressed the supply chain, financing and high-cost aspects of the agriculture sector on Kaashidhoo and enabled farmers to streamline their operations in a more cost-effective manner. However, the NGO found that easy access to fertilizers and pesticides without adequate technical know-how encouraged farmers to use these supplies indiscriminately. Thus, future plans include further interventions in the sector, among which will be the provision of complementary training. The island of Kaashidhoo is located in Kaafu Atoll, 87.54 km south of Male’. It has a population of 2,010 and a land area of 276.49 hectares. With much of the island not built on (fig. 1), a significant segment of the population, predominantly Figure 1 Kaashidhoo is a large island that has a great deal of space for agriculture. Growing Well: Maldives 265 women, is actively engaged in agricultural activities while others take on the role of buying from the farmers and supplying resorts and markets outside the island. Being located in the same atoll as the capital island, Male’, and many surrounding tourist resorts, Kaashidhoo has the advantage of being close to a large market for its agricultural produce. The island was completely flooded by the tsunami of December 2004, with many buildings and homes damaged and more than half of the farm land affected. Local farmers subsequently attempted to restore cultivation but faced difficulties reinvesting as their income-earning source was no longer functional, and many families had to renovate their damaged homes as well. While agricultural supplies such as plant food were being retailed by a small number of businesses on the island, these businesses were unable to guarantee a constant supply, which resulted in price fluctuations of up to 40 per cent when the stock ran low. As a result, farmers were unable to afford essential supplies and faced long waits for the stock to arrive on the island. Consequently, some of their existing crops withered and they had difficulties in regenerating their plots. When the call for proposals for SouthSouth Grants Facility (SSGF) funding was announced by UNDP, the local NGO, FANAARU, proposed a project to address the need to make a constant supply of agricultural inputs available on Kaashidhoo at reasonable and stable prices. According to its proposal, the community would contribute approximately 22 per cent of the project cost, which would finance the setting up of a shop for agricultural supplies on the island.",

    "abstract": "The project supported the restoration of livelihoods of the predominantly female farmer community in Kamadhoo, Baa Atoll, by rehabilitating the island’s banana plantations, which had been debilitated in the wake of the tsunami. The reasons for the decrease in the crop yield and the size of the fruit were assessed with technical assistance from the Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources. Measures to improve the situation were identified and implemented. Hands-on training in composting and appropriate farming techniques was conducted for the community on two separate occasions during the year, and a pilot community composting project was initiated. The plots were regenerated and replanted with bananas and other cash crops as desired by the community and a good-quality harvest was witnessed by the end of the project period. As a result, the income-earning capacity of farmers was restored and the potential for higher incomes was created. Owing to the high demand from tourist resorts and other inhabited islands in the region, the capital invested in the agricultural regeneration was recovered within 14 months. The project witnessed the active participation and empowerment of women, who gained technical knowledge on sustainable agricultural development and are now practising cultivation in a more organized manner. The island of Kamadhoo in Baa Atoll of the Maldives is about 129 km from Male’ and has a land area of 16.2 hectares. The population of 430, approximately half of which is female, is grouped in 59 households and is economically active in the tourism, reef fishery and agriculture industries. A large number of the men work away from the island while many women are active in farming. With tourist resorts and several inhabited islands in the atoll, there is a significant demand for the island’s agricultural produce. On Kamadhoo, each dwelling in which residents are interested in farming is allocated a plot of agricultural land for a three-year period, which can be extended subject to its satisfactory use. As a result, around 60 plots of land with an average size of 2,000 sq ft had been under cultivation prior to the tsunami, primarily to grow banana trees and limited quantities of other cash crops, which were sold mainly to resorts and islands in the region. However, in the aftermath of the tsunami, the crop yield decreased and the size of bananas produced became too small to be sold in the market. The farming community believed that the salt water that had swept over the island had caused severe soil degradation, culminating in the poor yield. The community, eager to regenerate the plantation to its former condition and return to its established incomeearning activity, had approached the Flavourful Produce: Maldives 275 Island Development Committee (IDC) with its issues. When the call for proposals for funding by the South-South Grants Facility (SSGF) went out, the Kamadhoo IDC proposed a project with a total budget of $41,339 to assist with assessing the cause of the poor banana yield, identifying possible measures to improve the situation, conducting training in composting and farming techniques, and initiating a pilot community composting project on its island. The IDC committed $16,346 of community funding to this endeavour, highlighting the importance accorded to it by the community. Upon confirmation of funds, Island Office channels were used to communicate the needs of the community to the Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources in Male’. IDC asked the Ministry for technical assistance to assess existing conditions and provide it with suggestions for improving its yield.",

    "abstract": "Tangalle had been badly affected during the tsunami of December 2004. The main objectives of this project were to improve the livelihoods of the tsunamiaffected people and develop infrastructure in Tangalle. The project was carried out in two phases. The first phase focused on livelihood improvement. During this phase, the Human and Environmental Development Foundation (HEDF), a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in Tangalle, Hambantota District that had been working in the area since 2002, received a total of $10,000 from the South-South Grants Facility (SSGF). This money was allocated for the improvement of livelihoods of 92 families in five villages. These funds were used for training in dressmaking for 30 women, training workshops in management skills for 50 people to help them restart their enterprises, capacity-building training for 20 community members representing eight community-based organizations (CBOs), and disbursement of revolving loans to 42 members. The second phase of the project included activities in infrastructure development and livelihood improvement. In this phase, HEDF received $12,000 from the SSGF to extend its existing livelihood programme to two more villages and to reconstruct minor infrastructure. It made available revolving loans to 23 families for restarting their income-generation activities. The amount of the loan that they received depended on the nature of the activity in which they were engaged. The interest on the loan was calculated using the reducing balance method. The community members are happy with this system as it does not pose a high burden with respect to the interest. Repayment of the loans has been satisfactory to date. The interest of the loan is credited to the CBO and is held in a bank account under its name. The project also provided minor infrastructure facilities such as toilets to selected beneficiaries in the second phase. Sri Lanka recorded a loss of 40,000 lives and a staggering 2.5 million people displaced by the tsunami of December 2004. The tidal wave, 6 metres high in some areas, crashed into coastal villages, sweeping away people, buildings, vehicles and, in one instance, 1,700 commuters in a train. It changed the environment in the area, destroyed community economies and left the communities traumatized. The beneficiaries were displaced and were living in transition shelters. Tangalle was among the areas badly affected. The project area is in the vicinity of the Tangalle lagoon. The main occupation of these coastal villages is fishing. Moneylenders, A Vanishing Race Here: Sri Lanka 295 Small-scale enterprises such as clay and pottery work, vegetable cultivation in home gardens and motor mechanics are some of the other occupations. The Human and Environmental Development Foundation (HEDF), a non-governmental organization (NGO), had been working in this area since 2002 with the Coast Conservation Department (CCD). It had carried out a project for establishing a green belt on the coastline of Tangalle with the collaboration of CCD, which gave it an opportunity to interact and to develop a good rapport with the people of the area. The working relationship that it developed would help in the implementation of the SSGF project. Many of the partners with whom HEDF had worked in these villages were affected by the tsunami. Soon after the tsunami devastation, HEDF conducted a survey to assess the needs in regard to income-generation. Most of the villagers had been engaged in fishing. Others had had small-scale enterprises, coir production mills, potteries and other small-scale domestic enterprises. The tsunami destroyed the properties and means of income-generation of these communities to a great extent.",

    "abstract": "The Centro Argentino Brasileño de Biotecnología (CABBIO, in Spanish) or Centro Brasileiro Argentino de Biotecnologia (in Portuguese) is a binational initiative that promotes collaborative efforts in biotechnology. In the early 1980s, Argentina and Brazil decided to combine efforts in recognition of the revolution being created by modern biotechnology and taking into account the potential of both countries in this area of knowledge: a broad agricultural base, a wealth of biodiversity and considerable scientific capacity in biology and related areas. Together, the two countries created a structure that has survived changes in ministries and governments, one in which the highest level of decision-making involves the ministries of science and foreign affairs. The international protocol that supports this programme has allowed the initiative to continue for more than 15 years, including periods during which the economies of both countries have suffered tempestuous times. CABBIO, which has two focal points, one in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and the other in Brasilia, Brazil, is run by a small technical staff with the cooperation of unpaid advisory committees in both countries. The organization implements two types of activity: joint projects and joint postgraduate courses. Courses, the costs of which are covered in full for all participants, are selected from an open bid of offers and must involve lecturers and students from at least the two countries. Between 1986 and 2004, CABBIO funded 206 courses, 97 of which were held in Argentina, 105 in Brazil, two in Colombia and two in Uruguay. To date, more than 3,000 students have attended the courses, mostly from Brazil and Argentina but also from Paraguay, Uruguay and other Latin American countries. These international courses are a very strong force for integration, since bonds created among the participants frequently result in joint projects and long-standing research cooperation. In addition, up until 2005, 95 joint projects were financed. Several of these v Costs: The total cost of the project (1987 to 2002) was US$14.5 million shared about equally between the two participating countries; this is equivalent to  US$7.3 million per country over 16 years. These funds were supplied by government sources. It should be emphasized that the binational council allocates the funds for the projects and training courses, that these activities are paid for in the local currencies of Argentina and Brazil and that funds are not transferred between countries. Binational Cooperation: Argentina and Brazil 15 projects have been important for the development of the Argentine and Brazilian platforms in biotechnology and have produced some “firsts” in the area. From an economic point of view, the most important advance has been the development of a method for producing virus-free garlic and its uptake by farmers in both countries. Other notable successes have been the first transgenic mouse created in both countries, a vaccine for foot-and-mouth disease, the development of shrimp farming, biological pest control protocols, transgenic plants and probiotic cultures that are now commercially available in pharmacies. Argentina and Brazil have a long-standing rivalry inherited from the colonial struggles between Spain and Portugal. This rivalry reached a peak in the 1970s when Brazil proposed building the Itaipu dam on the Parana River, which flows into Argentina. Concerned about losing control of a valuable water resource, Argentina responded by threatening air strikes against the construction site. In addition, roads between the two countries were poorly maintained to prevent their use by armed forces. In the early 1980s, when both countries adopted democratic governments, this situation was reversed and, in 1985, the presidents of Argentina and Brazil signed a series of protocols of understanding, including one on cooperation in biotechnology. At that time, Argentina had a relatively strong scientific base, especially in the biological sciences, and Brazil was expanding its university system, with emphasis on the importance of scientific research as an essential component. The revolutionary impact of modern biotechnology, including genetic engineering, was also becoming apparent and both countries, realizing the potential of biotechnology in developing their agricultural industries, decided to embrace the new science. Protocol No. 9 on Biotechnology, signed by the two presidents in July 1986, created the Centro Argentino Brasileño de Biotecnología (CABBIO). Since then, while some of the protocols signed have been discontinued, Protocol No. 9 has flourished. Some years later, other joint protocols resulted in the creation of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) through the Treaty of Asuncion, signed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in March 1991. At the time when Protocol No. 9 was signed, in the mid 1980s, there were many biochemists in Argentina, many of whom had been trained in Buenos Aires. In addition, there was scientific cooperation as many Argentine professors gave courses at Brazilian universities, especially in the most developed States of Parana, Rio, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo, where most of the research output of Brazil was concentrated. There were also agricultural research institutes in both countries (the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuária (INTA) in Argentina and the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (EMBRAPA) in Brazil), with numerous research stations scattered throughout both countries. These institutions had been cooperating in several areas, in particular in the control of the foot-and-mouth disease of cattle. With the rapid advance of biotechnology in the early 1980s, many governments supported the new field as a priority and considered the development of their own research institutes and national programmes. In Argentina, instead of creating of one single biotechnology centre, it was considered more appropriate to foster development across the area. Therefore, when the two presidents met at Iguaçu Falls in July 1986, the idea was ripe and Protocol No. 9 and CABBIO were established. Together, two distinguished scientists, one from each country, (José La Torre from Argentina and Edmundo Reichmann from Brazil), developed the rules under which CABBIO would operate. In subsequent years, these rules have proven to be effective in shielding CABBIO from political attack when governments have changed. The proposal for the structure and functioning of CABBIO was accepted on 10 December 1986 and CABBIO became fully operative in January 1987.  The first meeting of the governing binational council was in April 1987; since then, it has been meeting twice a year.",

    "abstract": "The Network of Instrument Technical Personnel and User Scientists of Bangladesh (NITUB) was created primarily to train technical personnel and user scientists so that they would become capable of maintaining their own laboratory equipment. It was soon realized that the scientists were facing problems in tackling their own equipment repairs. NITUB responded to this by deciding to establish a nucleus of trained manpower that could respond to such situations. The installation and commissioning of imported equipment was another important issue for scientists. Imported laboratory equipment, both standard machines and more specialized, expensive items, was often found lying unpacked waiting for technical personnel to arrive from abroad to install it. NITUB, therefore, expanded its mandate to include the installation of equipment. With the success of these operations, NITUB is now in the process of taking up contractual assignments with different scientific organizations for the regular maintenance and servicing of equipment. Since the programme began in 1994, NITUB activities have earned the appreciation of different scientific disciplines of the universities and research institutions of Bangladesh. Now, scientists regularly contact NITUB for advice concerning both equipment procurement and repair. The two major funding agencies from Sweden, the International Programme in the Chemical Sciences (IPICS) and the International Foundation for Science (IFS), have also recognized the usefulness of the network and have recommended that neighbouring Nepal and countries of West Africa adopt the NITUB model for keeping their laboratory equipment in working order. The contribution of NITUB to the country’s scientific enterprise has also been appreciated by some ministries of the Government of Bangladesh, which have responded by funding some of the NITUB work programme. v Costs: Funds have been received from different sources. Those received between 1996 and 2004 total some US$140,900 and include: US$87,000 from the International Programme in the Chemical Sciences (IPICS), Sweden; US$25,000 from the International Foundation for Science (IFS), Sweden; US$5,000 from the Government of Bangladesh; US$3,000 from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the Netherlands; US$1,400 from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); US$4,000 from other local sources; and US$15,500 received as training fees. Teaching Equipment Repair Skills: Bangladesh 29 Most of the scientific instruments used in Bangladesh are imported from Germany, Japan, Sweden, the United States or the United Kingdom through local agents. In some cases, the purchase covenants include installation and servicing at regular intervals. Unfortunately, the local agents often do not have the necessary skills and experience to do these jobs nor do the purchasing institutions themselves. Besides installation, equipment repairs are another major problem. Frequently, a number of pieces of equipment are out of order in different institutions owing to the lack of adequate repair facilities, causing frustration for those scientists wishing to progress in their work. In addition, waiting for equipment to be installed by experts from the suppliers can take a long time and it is often found that the warranty period has expired before the experts nominated by the principal supplier are available to install the equipment. Furthermore, installation and repair work by foreign experts is expensive as it involves a substantial amount of travelling and per diem expenses for such personnel. Thus, the lack of proper technical personnel for taking good care of scientific equipment, including its installation, maintenance and repair, has been felt in Bangladesh for many years. In order to alleviate the situation, especially for the instruments of the universities of Bangladesh, the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh instituted the Institute of Scientific Instruments (ISI). Unfortunately, this agency also failed to deliver the required services. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Professor M. Mosihuzzaman was the Dean of the Faculty of Science of Dhaka University. Like others in those days, Mosihuzzaman had received a number of expensive pieces of laboratory equipment from two foreign donors, IPICS and IFS, but was having difficulty in keeping the equipment running. He therefore decided to create a forum for developing technical know-how relating to scientific equipment among the technical personnel and user scientists of Bangladesh. He was joined in these efforts by Professor M. Shamsul Huq, chairman of the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh and Professor Mesbahuddin Ahmad, president of the Bangladesh Chemical Society. Dr. M. Eusuf, then head of the Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR), the country’s largest stakeholder in terms of scientific equipment, soon joined the group, as did Professor Altaf Husain, Professor Nilufar Nahar and Professor Nishat Ahmed Pasha from the Department of Chemistry, Dhaka University, and Dr. M.R. Hasan of the Department of Fisheries, Biology and Limnology of Bangladesh Agricultural University. On behalf of the group, Prof. Mosihuzzaman discussed the issue of training technical personnel and user scientists with IPICS and IFS officials and solicited their moral and financial support. The agencies responded very positively and a week-long workshop on instrument maintenance and repair for scientists holding IPICS and IFS grants was held from 16 to 21 November 1991, sponsored by the two organizations. This workshop was followed by a second workshop from 12 to 25 January 1994 in which user scientists and technical personnel of different institutions participated. In an open discussion that took place during the concluding session of the second workshop, it became clear that most scientific organizations in Bangladesh did not have the necessary manpower to maintain and repair their equipment. Although the workshop participants regarded the training that they had received as useful, they requested the opportunity to attend such courses for a longer duration. In addition, providing access to such an initiative to all the scientific institutions that wished to participate required the organization of a number of programmes providing training tailored to specific pieces of equipment. At this point, the workshop organizers proposed the formation of a network of technical personnel and user scientists. Representatives of IPICS and IFS present at the workshop welcomed the proposal and expressed their moral support.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge-sharing for local development in Egypt plays an important role in establishing an “information society” in the country. It has two strategic objectives: the first relates to the spread of information technology (IT) tools nationwide, while the second focuses on the foundation of an IT-aware community. Egypt is an emerging market with a multitude of investment opportunities. It is considered a major centre of knowledge-sharing for local development in the South, being an international telecommunications hub with a number of global and regional fibre-optic cables having their landing points in the country. In order to make the best use of these facilities, to provide Egyptian scientists with the IT infrastructure enjoyed by their colleagues elsewhere and to provide career opportunities for prospective engineers opting to pursue postgraduate studies, there was an urgent need to launch a national programme in IT research. Beginning in 2004, the National Research Centre (fig. 1), through its Systems and Information Department, initiated information system research activities. This programme, given high priority by the National Research Centre and the Government of Egypt, was designed to be part of the efforts aimed at transforming Egypt into an information society, with the goal of offering every individual and community the opportunity to harness the benefits of the new information era. Figure 1 Egypt’s National Research Centre, located in Cairo. The Egyptian Universities Network (EUN) was established in 1987 to facilitate the electronic exchange of data among universities. Since 1993, it has v Costs: Funding has been received mainly from the Government of Egypt through its support of the National Research Centre. Costs cover the salaries of the project team, assistant researchers and engineers as well as computer systems and networks. Annual financing, covering set-up and running costs, amounts to 75,000 Egyptian pounds (about US$13,000). Building an Information Society: Egypt 41 administered Egypt’s Internet-level domain (.eg). Thanks to EUN, all Egyptian national universities, including Al-Azhar, the oldest national university in Egypt, and some academic research centres are connected to the Internet. A national plan for information and communication technologies (ICTs) was issued in December 1999, with a special focus on promoting national demand for IT, developing sector projects and enhancing the national software export industry. Following this, Egypt’s telecommunications infrastructure has expanded dramatically. Telecom Egypt, for example, has revolutionized its service portfolio and there have been significant developments in providing access to the Internet, mainly through public-private partnership schemes. In addition, Egypt’s mobile phone operators complement a rapidly advancing telecommunications industry. The use of such wireless technology has been a decisive factor in efforts to provide universal access to ICTs, especially in outlying rural areas.  Such infrastructural developments aim to guarantee universal, simple, affordable and rapid access to ICTs and have been complemented by such government schemes as “A PC for Every Home”, the provision of free Internet access, IT clubs and an initiative to introduce broadband connections to the country. The Internet now plays an important role in many aspects of Egyptian society, including: • e-Health: an initiative aimed at synchronizing efforts among health authorities to increase the use and availability of patients’ medical histories for hospitals and medical practitioners; • e-Environment: an effort to coordinate Egypt’s strategy for conservation and environmental reform, with special emphasis on preserving its Red Sea marine ecosystem; • e-Content: a scheme aimed at promoting the development of materials in a wide range of categories, including books, radio and television media, arts, education, sport and entertainment and designed to enrich Arabic content in the digital format; • e-Culture: a long-term plan to manage and protect cultural heritage, promote cultural e-content, support artistic creation and new ways of expression, and improve the skills and efficiency of personnel working in the field of cultural and natural heritage by introducing them to automation concepts and the use of ICTs in documentation and publishing; • e-Government: an initiative designed to modernize and improve the efficiency of the Government of Egypt by making it easier for citizens to access public services; and • e-Business: a scheme designed to build and expand a strong IT infrastructure that will contribute to supporting the business community and encourage foreign direct investment. The effective implementation of these initiatives requires a critical mass of trained personnel. Therefore, the Systems and Information Department of the National Research Centre has started its research activities in IT as well as the provision of a range of training courses, including postgraduate studies and summer workshops.",

    "abstract": "The globe artichoke crop is of considerable economic importance in Egypt. Some 3,000 hectares are planted with the crop and annual production is about 70,000 tons. Traditionally, artichoke flower heads (the edible part of the plant) appear in Egyptian markets at the end of February, with most production harvested during March and April. This relatively short season provides little opportunity for growers to export their product. In cooperation with the College of Agriculture, Ain Shams University and the Ministry of Agriculture of Egypt, the National Research Centre (NRC) aimed to develop a system for producing earlymaturing globe artichokes as well as increasing the area under cultivation by expanding the area planted to include semi-arid land. To achieve these goals, three parallel efforts were undertaken. First, instead of propagating plants using traditional methods such as planting offshoots and dividing crown segments, tissue-cultured plantlets were introduced. This allowed the production of diseasefree plantlets with well-developed root systems that enabled the crop to develop quickly in the field and helped growers to obtain an early yield. Second, a water saving drip irrigation system was introduced. Third, an optimized fertilization regime was developed. As a result of introducing these three practical innovations, based on the latest scientific and technical methods, to artichoke producers, the area planted with artichokes was increased to include semi-arid land, yet water savings of some 40 per cent have been achieved. In addition, early yields were increased, providing farmers with excess production for export to more lucrative markets. Following the experience, farmers’ incomes have increased significantly. The National Research Centre (NRC) is a multidisciplinary institution consisting of 11 divisions and 70 departments that carries out research into basic and advanced technologies aimed at serving the national economy. The Egyptian agricultural sector depends largely on cash crops. Therefore, NRC has carried out several studies aimed at developing such crops, including the globe artichoke, using suitable new technologies. In Egypt, the globe artichoke is tradi v Costs: US$70,000, comprising US$40,000 from the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and US$30,000 from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Exporting Artichokes: Egypt 49 tionally propagated vegetatively using stump cuttings (crown pieces) and offshoots. After the harvest, during the period from May to August, growers typically leave about 3,000 square metres of old mother plants from which they will select young offshoots and stump cuttings with which to plant each hectare of the next crop. The technique of stumping involves cutting the artichoke plants about five centimetres below ground level. Often, these cuttings are then planted in a nursery area three to four weeks before transplanting into the field when the new planting season starts, usually in the first week of September. An advantage of these vegetative techniques for artichoke propagation is that growers are able to the select mother plants that they will retain for the next growing season according to agronomic qualities such as plant vigour, earliness, head quality and yield. On the other hand, only around 60 to 70 per cent of the transplants survive, especially when stump cuttings are transferred directly into the field. In addition, there may be large differences in physiological age between detached offshoots and stump cuttings, leading to differences in the timing of head initiation and harvest. Moreover, vegetative propagation methods favour the spread of bacterial, fungal, viral and nematode problems from one generation of plants to the next. In Egypt, local cultivars account for the major part of artichoke production. These varieties, however, are often very variable, and the flower heads (the part that is eaten) tend to be of poor quality unsuitable for export purposes. In addition, the best prices are obtained for artichokes produced in the early part of the season (February). Therefore, NCR embarked on a project to help farmers improve both the quality and earliness of their artichoke crops, bringing the harvesting season forward into December and January in efforts to boost both artichoke exports and farmers’ profits.",

    "abstract": "HIV/AIDS is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. In Ghana alone, some 350,000 people are infected with the disease and more than 30,000 people have died from it. Ignorance concerning the way the disease is transmitted leads to many of these people being excluded from society and even ostracized by their families. To counter these misunderstandings and tackle the spread of the HIV/AIDS virus requires a range of medical, sociological and educational initiatives. The Foresight Generation Club, established in 2002, uses new and increasingly available computer-based information and communication technologies (ICTs) to teach young people not only to become computer literate but also about the realities of HIV/AIDS. Working together in groups and using specially developed interactive software packages, some 3,000 Ghanaian youths, many of them young women, have received such training over the past three years. Follow-up questionnaires confirm that the interactive teaching methods have brought about positive behavioural changes among those who have attended the ICT training courses. In addition, many young people have found employment in ICT-related businesses or, using their newly found expertise, have established their own Internet cafés and telecentres. Over the next three years, the project aims to provide ICT training with imbedded HIV/AIDS awareness-raising sessions to some three million young people in Ghana. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 10 per cent of the world’s population but 60 per cent of those living with HIV/AIDS, accounting for some 25 million people. In Ghana, the disease affects 3.1 per cent of the adult population, or a total of 350,000 people. Antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV/AIDS patients are readily available in developed countries but are too expensive for widespread use in the South. In addition, there is widespread ignorance in many African societies concerning how the disease is spread.  This ignorance leads to misunderstandings about the disease and its victims and has led to a stigma being attached to HIV/AIDS patients, which means that they are discriminated against in a variety v Costs: To date, the project has cost some US$48,000, most of which has been donated by individuals, small collaborating organizations, youth groups and, more recently, the Global Junior Challenge, based in Rome, Italy. Mobilizing ICT against HIV/AIDS: Ghana 57 of ways. Often HIV/AIDS patients are made redundant so that they lose the ability to provide for themselves and their families. In addition, they may be ostracized by their communities and perhaps even by their families. Against this background, many national and international organizations have implemented HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Studies carried out prior to this initiative, however, revealed that, even though understanding of HIV/AIDS had increased, many people had not changed their lifestyle practices and the disease was still spreading. Indeed, research carried out in Ghana has shown that the impact of such awareness campaigns is diminishing and there is a need for new, innovative approaches to get the message across. Surveys carried out in Ghana revealed that more than 60 per cent of the target age group (15- to 45-year-olds) left school with a junior secondary education or less, whereas some 30 per cent were educated to the senior secondary school level. Perhaps because of this lack of general education, studies carried out in collaboration with a sister organization, Young African Achievers, showed that knowledge of ICTs was generally very poor in such countries as Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa. However, the same research highlighted a great interest, especially among young people, in learning more about the technology and its uses. This is possibly because many of these people who have received little education are now working in low-paid jobs or are unemployed. They also tend to lead promiscuous lifestyles, thus enhancing the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, the surveys also showed that well-educated people with relatively high standards of living were also interested in ICTs and the possibility of advancing their careers by improving their knowledge of the technology. To tackle these dual issues – the continuing spread of HIV/AIDS and the desire among a generally uneducated population to learn more about ICTs – the project, “ICT for Development and a Strategic Tool in the Global Fight against HIV/AIDS and the Related Stigma”, was conceived. To design the programme, a group of industry ICT experts and other professionals, including staff of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working on HIV/AIDS, came together to establish the Foresight Generation Club in February 2002. The project was conceived as a way to tackle computer and Internet illiteracy among young people and, in the process, provide information about HIV/AIDS, outlining its prevalence within the community, how it is transmitted (and, just as importantly, how it is not transmitted), and the steps that can be taken to protect oneself against infection. The initial location chosen for the implementation of the project was Tema, a small city in southeast Ghana not far from the capital, Accra.",

    "abstract": "The M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) is a major partner in the organization of the Open Knowledge Network, which builds on the ongoing “Information Village Research Project” that was initiated by MSSRF in 1998. The Open Knowledge Network was created in response to the fact that, although more and more people are able to access the Internet, few people in rural India were doing so mainly because there was little useful information available to them in their own language. The Open Knowledge Network, therefore, was conceived as “the Internet for the world’s poor”. It provides a space to communicate, to express ideas and to voice opinions. Its aim is to empower the poor by providing them with the tools and the skills to input, at no cost, their own local content in their own local language and to help them to provide the information services that will actually make a difference in their lives. As the Open Knowledge Network has expanded, there is now the possibility of sharing their local content with other communi ties around the world. The principal focus of the Open Knowledge Network, therefore, is people and, in particular, what they want and what is relevant to their lives. This knowledge-sharing is assisted rather than controlled or ruled by technology. The Open Knowledge Network was designed around several principles: • building on the experience of others; • building capacity in communities to support knowledge-sharing; • working offline for free but synchronizing with the Internet; • developing the peer-to-peer networking of existing knowledge workers; • agreeing standards for metadata using extensible markup language (XML); • agreeing open content copyright licences; and • developing sustainable business models adapted to different contexts. v Costs: Costs for the MSSRF parts of the scheme implemented by the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation amount to some US$110,000 (2002-2005). This funding has been obtained mainly from the Department for International Development, Government of the United Kingdom, and supplied through OneWorld and OneWorld South Asia. Building Open Knowledge Networks: India 67 Peter Armstrong of United Kingdombased OneWorld International first conceived the idea behind the Open Knowledge Network and discussed it with representatives from OneWorld International, MSSRF, Harvard Law School, Accenture (a global management consulting and technology services company) and other stakeholders during a two-day workshop held in London in October 2001. Having received a positive response, OneWorld International piloted the scheme through the Digital Opportunity Task Force of the Group of Eight (G8 DOT Force) under its Local Content Programme. Then, in February and March 2002, OneWorld International and MSSRF tested the Open Knowledge Network concept in a short pilot in a cluster of villages in Pondicherry in southern India, where MSSRF was already running a local-level knowledgesharing initiative, the Information Village Research Project. Following this trial run, in May 2002, the Open Knowledge Network concept was refined and presented to an international workshop held at MSSRF. The workshop was attended by more than 40 participants representing grass-roots information initiatives from Africa, Asia and Latin America as well as international organizations, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector. At the time, the knowledge centres involved in the MSSRF Information Village Research Project needed to expand their services. Instead of providing need-based information in only a few villages, for example, incorporating the new Open Knowledge Network system would enable many more villages and needy communities in India and around the world to participate in sharing their indigenous knowledge. To begin the implementation of the Open Knowledge Network at villages selected by MSSRF, Peter Armstrong worked with the MSSRF team for a month in early 2002. Other members of the team were also involved in these early stages. Building on the MSSRF Information Village Research Project at Pondicherry, the Open Knowledge Network has introduced a clear focus to the collection and dissemination of indigenous knowledge. Several volunteers received training in how to gather and edit useful content, and many villagers, especially women, came forward to provide valuable information pertaining to indigenous practices, such as the preparation of medicines from local plants, cures for cattle diseases and recipes for ethnic cuisine. The Open Knowledge Network also brought in new and innovative technology. Content is now uploaded to a WorldSpace satellite via an uploading station in the United Kingdom, while village communities receive the content using a WorldSpace radio connected to a personal computer. They can then download whatever they require from the computer.",

    "abstract": "The indigenous people of Ngata Toro, Sulawesi, Indonesia, live within the Lore Lindu National Park and, for generations, have relied on the native tropical forest to provide them with a variety of foods, medicines, timber and other products. The community also manages its own traditional forest area (or “huaka”). Since 1993, the Ngata Toro community has established and implemented several initiatives designed to strengthen and represent their cultural identity. The ultimate aim of these projects is to protect and to manage the tropical forest ecosystems, to manage and to harvest sustainably the forest’s natural resources for the long-term well-being of the community, and, in so doing, to guarantee a better future for the next generation. The indigenous people of Ngata Toro originally lived at Malino, close to the centre of what is now the protected area of Lore Lindu National Park. Based on a decision made by the elders in the fifteenth century, they then moved to their current location at Ngata Toro, which is still inside the protected area. For generations, the Ngata Toro community lived in harmony with the forest, managing it in their traditional way, and practised simple agroforestry, growing coffee and rice (fig. 1). The enactment of a national law on village governance in the 1970s meant that indigenous communities were not encouraged to practise their customary laws. Instead, such communities were placed under more stringent political control from the national government. At Ngata Toro, for example, this meant that women were no longer allowed to sit v Costs: Between 2000 and 2004, the Council for the Indigenous People of Ngata Toro received some US$50,000, including US$30,000 from the Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme (GEF-SGP) Indonesia, a fund used to help communities to document and manage their traditional knowledge and cultural identity. Other contributors have included the Aliansi Masyarakat Adat Nusantara (Indigenous People’s Alliance of the Archipelago), the Asia Foundation and CARE International Indonesia. The roles of the Bogor Institute of Agriculture, Indonesia, and Wageningen University, the Netherlands, as well as church, local and national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should also be taken into account. Documenting Traditional Knowledge for Community Development: Indonesia 79 together in the traditional house of the council (“lobo”) and therefore had no consultative or decision-making power concerning the management of forest resources. As a result, the village became more paternalistic. In addition, when the Government formally created Lore Lindu National Park in 1993, the local communities were confused by the conflicting status conferred on their traditional lands and were unsure of whether they had secure tenure and the right to utilize forest resources. Communal land ownership and land tenure by indigenous peoples, for example, were not legally recognized by the State and there was a conflicting dualism of authority between the traditional structure of village governance and national governance. This conflict led to resistance by many communities living in and around the Lore Lindu area to the moves of the Government, especially as, in practice, it meant that local communities had limited access to and control over their traditional forest resources. At the same time, the natural forest within Lore Lindu National Park was suffering from logging and land clearance Figure 1 The Ngata Toro people have traditionally grown rice in paddy fields close to the forest boundaries. for agriculture and tree plantations, including cocoa. Other threats to the integrity of the forest included the poaching of animals, the unsustainable harvest of various plants, the use of poison and electricity to catch fish, and the overuse of pesticides in paddy fields and for other agricultural products. Today, Lore Lindu National Park is protected, but the concept of conservation proposed by the Government and international NGOs relies heavily on exclusive preservation without understanding the rights of the indigenous people and local communities that had inhabited and managed the forests for centuries before the national park was created.",

    "abstract": "Small-scale farmers growing coffee as a cash crop suffered a serious setback to their livelihoods when the price of coffee fell. Looking for alternative sources of income from their land, many farmers neglected their coffee bushes and planted food crops between the rows, which they treated with composted manure. The farmers noted that the coffee plants survived despite the weeds and without the chemical control of pests and diseases. By weeding the crop and increasing the application of manure, farmers obtained both good yields of coffee beans and harvests of food crops that supplemented their other food sources. Knowledge of this new system of chemical-free farming spread rapidly within the farming community, which has been quick to adopt the experience. Farmers are now maximizing production on their coffee plots. Initially, knowledge of this new system of small-scale farming was shared informally. However, through the creation of the Farmers’ Groups NetworkKenya (FAGNEK), the practice of knowledge-sharing is now being formalized by helping farmers to network with one another in small groups.  In this way, farmers can learn about new practices from one another but also share information about the best vegetable crops and varieties to grow. Currently, some 10,000 farmers are members of FAGNEK. Prior to this experience, small-scale coffee producers in Kenya relied heavily on the use of chemicals to control pests and diseases. These chemicals were expensive and hazardous to both the farmer and the environment. Their use also required technical knowledge that the farmers lacked, which led to their improper and ineffective use. Often, therefore, farmers experienced heavy crop losses without understanding the reasons why. They also did not realize that they could intercrop coffee with other crops as extension officers typically advised against this practice. In 2002, when the price of coffee fell, farmers abandoned their coffee bushes and began to experiment by planting other crops, including potatoes, beans and leafy vegetables, between the rows, fertilizing them with composted manure. In doing so, they realized that the coffee also yielded well despite the fact that no pesticides were being used and the bushes were not pruned as much as usual. In fact, by leaving five growing shoots per bush instead of the recommended three, farmers discovered that yields improved from 10 kilogrammes per bush to 20 kilogrammes per bush. Additional changes to the traditional agricultural practices included raising livestock indoors so that their waste could be harvested. Mixed with vegetable waste, it composts well to provide a rich source of organic fertilizer for the vegetable and coffee crops. Growing Together: Kenya 89 Now, not only are farmers obtaining a better yield of pesticide-free, higherquality coffee but they are also obtaining additional food sources from their plots of land (fig. 1). Farmers are further benefiting from a recent increase in the price of coffee. Figure 1 Farmer showing potatoes that he has grown between his rows of coffee bushes. However, working alone, no single farmer could have experimented with and developed the new system of intercropping coffee with vegetables without the use of pesticides. Initially through informal linkages and now through FAGNEK, farmers work in groups that allow them to meet periodically and to discuss recent progress and the way forward.",

    "abstract": "Established in 2001, the Mesoamerican Biotic Resources Network (REDMESO) brings together 23 public universities from Mexico and the Central American region. The network conducts research projects and develops technologies designed to support the sustainable management of ecosystems, having respect for both cultural and biological diversity. REDMESO endeavours to train professionals in research at a high scientific and technical level in order to improve the capacities of researchers in the region to respond to the needs of ecosystems and society. One of the main projects of REDMESO is the development of computer-mediated collaboration and communication structures operated through ten regional thematic virtual laboratories. This system, which enables the improvement of information storage and dissemination and supports enhanced communication processes between researchers in the Mesoamerican community, has the potential to strengthen capacity-building programmes in the region. Owing to the particular characteristics of land ownership and traditional natural resource management in Mexico and most other Central American countries, projects undertaken by REDMESO have always included participation by local communities as important components. Among current and completed REDMESO projects are a biodiversity analysis of El Salvador, a master’s degree programme relating to environmental risk assessment in Central America (EU-alpha), a Mesoamerican Geographic Information System (GIS) project and other initiatives. The Mesoamerican region is recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot. This situation is due to a combination of factors, v Costs: The Mexican Commission for Cooperation with Central America, a branch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of Mexico, is the main contributor to the network and has provided some US$1 million since the inception of the project. Currently the annual budget is US$50,000. The lead institution, the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos (UAEM, Autonomous University of the State of Morelos) contributes with some US$30,000 annually paid as salaries for the personnel responsible for the Online Virtual Unit. Other participating universities contribute mostly by offering their facilities for meetings or by providing accommodation for visiting scientists. Networking for Biodiversity Research: Mexico 97 among which are its position in the transition zone between two great biogeographical regions, the Nearctic and the Neotropical. The region also contains important mountain ranges that reach their highest altitude in the Mexican Pico de Orizaba at 5,610 metres above sea level, extensive coastal plains and lagoons, and the world’s secondlongest coral reef, extending for 1,000 kilometres along the Caribbean coast. Such a diversity of habitats and a wealth of biodiversity should be considered as a strategic resource for the future development of the region, especially in an age considered by many to be the golden age of biology. Advances in the biomedical sciences and biotechnology in particular are beginning to provide valuable economic returns. If, as expected, this trend continues, special emphasis needs to be placed on gaining a better understanding of the region’s biodiversity, including the construction and maintenance of inventories, databases and gene banks as well as on the establishment of strategies for the conservation of biodiversity, mainly through the establishment of natural protected areas (fig. 1). Individual researchers have made important contributions to biodiversity knowledge, conservation and sustainable management in Central America. However, if the region is to avoid being marginalized in the present biotechnological revolution (as was the case in the previous industrial, technological and information revolutions) and in order to prevent the further depletion of its natu ral resources (fig. 2), strategies must be implemented that enable the strengthening of its human resources and that promote the optimal use of its infrastructural capacity. Likewise, there is a need to train more researchers who will be able to generate new knowledge as well as professional personnel required for implementing new initiatives. Figure 1 Mesoamerica is home to a wide biodiversity that, using modern methods of biotechnology, could be exploited for economic benefit. Figure 2 Deforestation is only one of the ecological threats to the biodiversity of the Mesoamerican region as well as to the sustainable future of the local people. Before the establishment of the Mesoamerican Biotic Resources Network (REDMESO) in 2001, most of the region’s scientists were working in isolation to the detriment of development. On the other hand, in some instances there were a duplication of efforts and competition between laboratories. This was a highly unsustainable situation owing to the limited resources available for research and education.",

    "abstract": "In Nepal, several hundred kinds of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) of biological origin are used locally and traded more widely. The collection, trade and export of such products provided employment, at least seasonally, for many thousands of people.  However, preliminary studies revealed that inadequate access to information and marketing support was undermining the incomes of rural communities and entrepreneurs and constraining the development of the NTFP subsector. Through multi-stakeholder meetings coordinated by the Asia Network for Sustainable Agriculture and Bioresources (ANSAB), the need to provide information services was identified both by NTFP workers and by development organizations wishing to design and implement aid programmes. In order to collect and disseminate information in a systematic way, a marketing information system (MIS) was developed through multi-stakeholder interactions in 2001 by ANSAB. Now managed by ANSAB, the MIS collects, analyses and disseminates marketing information on various NTFPs to collectors, local traders, entrepreneurs and development facilitators through electronic, print and verbal media. The innovative aspect of this initiative is that it uses the network of existing organizations and projects to disseminate the information on NTFPs, including to remote areas that previously had little or no access to the required information. The benefits of the information provided were maximized by linking it with enterprise and market development programmes. Since the start of the programme in 2001, MIS activities have reached a large number of clients. The information service has raised the general level of interest in NTFP-associated businesses among potential entrepreneurs and support programmes and has assisted these agencies in the planning and management of various NTFP activities, including producing nursery-raised stock, harvesting, post v Costs: Total cost: US$126,237, of which US$70,200 were contributed by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), which provided support for the pilot project. In addition, $20,850 were received from such national organizations as Action Aid-Nepal, CARE-Nepal, the Livelihoods and Forestry Programme, the Netherlands Development Organization (SNV)-Nepal, the World Conservation Union (IUCN)-Nepal and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-Nepal. The current phase of the project, initiated in January 2004, is funded primarily by a three-year US$149,600 grant from the Interchurch Organisation for Development Cooperation (ICCO), the Netherlands. Market Information for Rural Workers: Nepal 109 harvest activities, processing and marketing. In addition, the information provided has increased the knowledge base and bargaining capacity of collectors and entrepreneurs, helping them to develop new enterprises and to find new markets for their products, and in turn has contributed to increasing their incomes, which has had a positive social impact. In particular, significant gains from increased prices to local collectors and traders were achieved when the MIS was linked with supporting enterprise activities. The information also helped the Government to take action to streamline royalty payments and taxes, banks to evaluate prospects of NTFP-based loan proposals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to design more povertyfocused programmes and communitybased enterprises to obtain higher sales prices. With access to information, NTFPs are increasingly being recognized for the diverse roles that they can play in conserving biodiversity, earning export revenues and providing rural people with sustainable livelihoods, especially in poor, isolated mountain communities. Nepal, which covers just 0.01 per cent of the Earth’s land area, is home to 2.6 per cent of all flowering plants, 9.3 per cent of birds and 4.5 per cent of mammals. Nearly 7,000 species of higher plants are found in Nepal, of which 5 per cent are endemic to the country and 10 per cent have medicinal or aromatic properties. With 75 different vegetation types recognized, ranging from dense tropical forests to alpine vegetation, the diverse ecosystems of Nepal provide a rich resource base for the provision of NTFPs. Traditionally, NTFPs have been important sources of livelihoods and income for Nepal’s poor mountain communities. Also, such communities were receiving very little from the sales of NTFPs, collection practices were typically extractive and sustainable harvesting was not encouraged. In contrast, the few regional traders that controlled the trade in NTFPs enjoyed good margins despite the fact that more than 90 per cent of the NTFPs were sold to India, mostly in an unprocessed form. Often, processing such natural products adds significant value. Prior to the project, ANSAB was implementing enterprise-oriented community resource management and livelihood enhancement programmes. An analysis of these revealed that the lack of marketing information was one of the major constraints to progress. It was realized that a good marketing information system (MIS) would assist ANSAB and its partners to improve the design of their enterprise development activities and to promote the marketing of NTFPs, which hold tremendous potential for increasing the income of the poor, especially those living in remote mountain regions for whom alternative sources of income are limited. During several meetings of the Nepal NTFP Network (NNN), coordi nated by ANSAB, other development organizations shared the same concerns. Promoted by ANSAB, NNN expanded to include more than 50 NTFP-related organizations and some 300 individual members by 2001. Follow-up NNN meetings and task force reports discussed the constraints to NTFP marketing and NTFP-based enterprise development in Nepal. Representatives from ANSAB, governmental organizations, the federation of community forest user groups, the private sector and development organizations were included in the task forces. Inadequate access to marketing information was consistently identified as one of the major areas that needed immediate attention as it was seriously undermining the ability of the rural people to improve their income from NTFPs.",

    "abstract": "Conflicts relating to land use and the management of natural resources have a long history in Nicaragua. Half of the country’s farmers do not own their land or own small, low-quality plots. Inappropriate land use, poor access to plots and a disconnection between national land policies and local land rights practices are at the heart of the problems. There is a demand on the part of communities and cooperatives for suitable solutions. Acción Contra el Hambre (ACH, Action against Hunger) considered how local institutions could contribute to the prevention and resolution of conflicts relating to access and use of land and natural resources and how the process of recognizing producers’ land rights could be made more efficient and accessible to even the poorest members of a community. In early 2004, the Gaspar García Laviana cooperative, located in the community of Telpaneca, Nicaragua, requested technical assistance from ACH for the purpose of carrying out an inventory of land parcels. A project was designed to seek an alternative local solution, including a low-cost methodology with a pronounced social dimension that would be easily accessible to all local organizations. “Communitarian cartography”, a method that uses easy-to-handle precision tools such as the global positioning system (GPS), is oriented towards the prevention and resolution of conflicts relating to land and the access and use of natural resources. The system was tested and developed through dialogue between all stakeholders. Some 288 families were involved and 688 parcels of land were measured. The cooperative now has a geo-referenced map of the community of Santo Domingo that identifies each agricultural parcel, forests, rivers, roads and footpaths. The locations of coffeegrowing areas, basic grain plantations and unused land are also identified. In addition, a public file of the properties measured is available and can be consulted by any cooperative member. This pilot project has demonstrated that sustainable technical solutions exist that, having been adapted to the local context, enable conflicts to be resolved and local populations to be involved in natural resource management. Thus, the technique contributes to good governance and can complement the activities of central government. The 2001 Food Security and Livelihoods Survey of the World Food Programme estimated that 45.8 per cent of the population of Nicaragua lives below the poverty line and that 15.1 per cent is extremely poor. Economically, Nicaragua is one of the most vulnerable countries in Latin America, with a per capita gross national product for 2002 of approximately US$500. Even though poverty affects more than half of the Nicaraguan Mapping Land Boundaries: Nicaragua 125 population, it is not distributed equally across the country. The province of Madriz in north-central Nicaragua, for example, where the project was implemented, is among the most vulnerable regions of the country. Seven of the nine municipalities of Madriz are listed as extremely poor. The topography of Madriz is craggy, marked by steep slopes, and some 7 per cent of the land is covered by forest. Most of the 134,000 inhabitants, however, depend on agriculture for their livelihood even though the region receives scarce rainfall (800 millimetres per year on average) and is prone to prolonged droughts. Other elements that exacerbate the poverty in Madriz province include: • vulnerable farming systems that depend almost entirely on single-crop production of basic grains and that also depend for cash on the sale of surplus production once the basic subsistence level has been exceeded. The recent fall in international prices for agricultural products, especially coffee, has made matters worse. • poor access, use and tenure of productive land. The development of the rural sector is strongly linked to these elements and, in Madriz, they are characterized by the fact that approximately 9 per cent of current properties stem from the unfinished Sandinista agrarian reform process of the 1980s, with its legacy of considerable insecurity in the land tenure system. For example, land leasing arrangements are usually short term (rarely longer than six months), preventing adequate land management or investment that might lead to optimal production. In addition, approximately 25 per cent of small producers have no documentation to prove that their land is entered in the property register. There is also no cadastre —public record system of surveying and mapping land for taxation purposes—implying that existing information regarding property is often erroneous. This leads to conflicts over borders between properties as well as between municipalities. Moreover, technical and economic limitations in both civil society and among the public authorities in Madriz hamper the use of innovative methods to promote and disseminate local mechanisms that might allow for proper land and natural resource management and territorial planning. Dialogue between ACH, local organizations and small farmers also revealed that: • half of the farmers do not own the land that they work or own only small or low-quality parcels of land; • there is a disconnection between national land policies and local land rights practices that is at the heart of a setting characterized by serious conflicts over land tenure; • the legalization (i.e., the process by which land ownership becomes legal) and registration of rural property, particularly smallholdings, are a problem, as the legalization of one manzana of land (0.7 hectares) costs as much as purchasing an additional manzana; and • there is a demand on the part of communities and cooperatives for adequate solutions to local management and physical planning of the local territory. Faced by unsatisfied demands for solutions, ACH sought ways to provide assistance that would contribute not only to conflict prevention and resolution but also to making the process of recognizing producers’ rights, acquired over time and through their work, more efficient. ACH thus designed a pilot project, seeking to develop a methodology with a strong social dimension and an implementation cost accessible at the local level. The project involved the development of a participatory cartography model to be used as a tool for the management of land and local natural resources. The Gaspar García Laviana cooperative, which participated in this experience, is located in the community of Santo Domingo de Telpaneca in the province of Madriz. Established on 890 hectares of land expropriated during the agrarian reform process that took place in the 1980s, it specializes in the production of coffee and basic grains (beans, maize and sorghum). The government that took office in 1990 suppressed much aid to agriculture, and the cooperative, like many others, faced problems regarding access to credit. In addition, the former owners returned and claimed the land. To counter these problems, members of the cooperative divided the land among themselves while keeping the overall property intact under the original title. Two kinds of parcels were distributed, depending upon whether the land was suitable for coffee or grain production. Along the same principles, the patios adjoining individual homes were “privatized” so that they now belong to the families of members of the cooperative and even to families that did not belong but lived in the community. The cooperative also left some areas of coffee and forest to collective management for the purpose of honouring collective debts. Community leaders expressed the need to make this division of the formerly collective property official.",

    "abstract": "The villages of Old Ekuri and New Ekuri are located on the edge of Cross River National Park in southeast Nigeria close to the border with Cameroon. The two villages jointly own 33,600 hectares of tropical forest on their communal land, which is probably the largest communally controlled forest remaining in Nigeria. A survey of the boundaries of the Ekuri community forest and the creation of a preliminary plan for the sustainable utilization of the area have apparently guaranteed the protection of the forest’s diverse flora and fauna as well as the soil, water and air essential for the well-being of the local Ekuri people and those living beyond the region. The communal ownership of trees within the forest and on Ekuri farmlands is contrary to the practices of many other communities in Nigeria and has been an important factor in preventing the large-scale deforestation seen elsewhere caused, in part, by individuals being able to acquire trees and sell them to logging companies. Several mechanisms, ranging from annual registration fees, sales taxes, gate fees and adding value to non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and agricultural products, are some of the innovations and improved revenue-generation sources that sustain individual households and the wider Ekuri community. Proceeds received from such sources of revenue have been used to construct a 40-kilometre road, to build and renovate school buildings and to provide scholarships for local students and training courses for other community members as well as to support the sick and a microcredit scheme. The Ekuri people elect a board to oversee the decisions of the community. This ensures democracy, transparency and community ownership of the decisions. Gender equality is maintained as women are actively involved in governance and management practices. The resulting effect is that Ekuri women are among the most outspoken rural women in the Cross River State of Nigeria. This confidence gave rise to the Kirsti Women’s Movement, a women’s community-based organization (CBO) that advocates for women’s rights and empowerment. Such successful initiatives v Costs: To date, the total cost of implementation amounts to US$435,000. Of this, US$120,000 are from internal income, US$100,00 from bilateral agreements between the Government of Nigeria and international development organizations, US$205,000 from foreign donors and US$10,000 from private donations. A Community Working Together: Nigeria 139 have inspired women from other rural communities in the region. The achievements of the Ekuri have meant that representatives from many communities from Nigeria and abroad have visited the Ekuri community as well as the Cross River State Forestry Commission and some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) replicating the Ekuri model in other communities in the State in order to learn from the Ekuri experience. The Ekuri Initiative outreach programme, for example, has been working with such neighbouring communities as Etara, Eyeyeng and Okokori Mfaminyen. The Ekuri community is made up of Old Ekuri and New Ekuri, two villages located six kilometres apart on the edge of Cross River National Park in southeast Nigeria close to the border with Cameroon. The two villages, with a population of about 6,000, jointly own 33,600 hectares of tropical forest on their communal land, which is probably the largest communally controlled forest remaining in Nigeria. The Ekuri people belong to the Nkukorli, a small indigenous group with a unique language, culture and traditions, which occupies only five villages. Until 1990, the nearest road access to both Old Ekuri and New Ekuri was a four-hour walk away. This forced community traders to carry all their products harvested from Ekuri farms and the forest to the road, where they were then sold to middlemen for low prices. Both villages realized that, with proper road access, people could take larger volumes of produce directly to markets in nearby towns and sell them for much better prices. At the same time, the community was being approached by logging companies attempting to make agreements with each village separately in order to divide them, offering the prospect of a road in exchange for logging rights.",

    "abstract": "Posada Amazonas Lodge (PAL) is a joint venture between the Ese’eja Native Community of Infierno (NCI) and a private ecotourism company, Rainforest Expeditions S.A.C. (RFE), based in Peru. Under a 20-year agreement between the two parties, which included building the lodge that is fully owned by NCI, training operations have begun by hiring community members to work at the lodge and benefit directly from its presence. Training is now being provided for technical and managerial positions so that, by the end of the 20-year agreement, NCI will be equipped to manage the lodge business on its own. Also under the agreement, decision-making is shared jointly, with a community Control Committee representing NCI in meetings with RFE. At each monthly meeting, members of the Control Committee receive practical training in decisionmaking concerning lodge operations and in human resources and financial management. In addition, NCI earns 60 per cent of the profits. PAL received its first guests in April 1998. With 30 double rooms, tourism numbers at PAL have increased steadily. In 2004, more than 6,000 tourists were hosted at the lodge, representing 20 per cent of the tourists that arrived in the v Costs: Total investments have been US$810,000, of which US$650,000 have been targeted at infrastructure, US$100,000 for training and US$60,000 for community decision-making and development. Funds received include: US$350,000 (comprising a US$110,000 loan and a US$240,000 grant) from the Peru-Canada Fund (1997) for the construction of the lodge; a US$50,000 grant from the World Bank (2001) for the construction of an artisan’s workshop, equipment and training of NCI artisans; a US$50,000 grant from the MacArthur Foundation (2002) for training community members for operational positions at the lodge (e.g., housekeepers, waiters, assistant cooks, boat operators) and technical positions (e.g., guides, chef, chief of maintenance, barman) and the development of the project’s communication strategy within the community; and a US$140,000 grant from the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund for community-based ecotourism exchanges between three projects, including one from Ecuador, one from Bolivia and Posada Amazonas Lodge (PAL). Community-based Ecotourism: Peru 153 nearby Tambopata region, home of the Tambopata National Reserve. Surveys have also revealed that customer satisfaction reaches 96 per cent. Currently, more than 100 community members have participated in training courses to work at PAL. Eighteen of the 20 permanent staff are community members, including the chef and the chief of maintenance, leaving only the manager and bartender to be trained; and seven community members are working as bilingual (English-Spanish) guides, leading tours for more than 2,000 tourists a year, with a client satisfaction rate of over 92 per cent. To date, NCI has received more than US$250,000 as its share of the profits from PAL, which has been invested in training guides to speak English; building a secondary school; building and operating a computer department for school children; buying a radio to facilitate communication between PAL and RFE; improving the road that connects Infierno with Puerto Maldonado (the closest city where tourists arrive by plane); travelling to events to publicize the operation; and helping community members in health emergencies. Owing to the success of PAL, other businesses have been created within the community, including a tourist port that charges US$0.50 per tourist; artisans who sell handicrafts at PAL; a fish farm that provides fish to PAL; the Nape Ethnobotanical Centre, which offers tours explaining the medicinal properties of the local plants to tourists; associations of corn and cassava producers; and a sustainable harvest committee. The PAL scheme has received international recognition through such awards as the Equator Prize of the United Nations Development Programme Equator Initiative in 2002. Since 1976, NCI has owned the title to 10,000 hectares of land, located in the buffer zone of the Tambopata National Reserve, a 1,366,106-hectare reserve of mostly tropical forest in southeastern Peru. The community is composed of 150 families of native Ese’eja and Colonos peoples who originally came from the Andes. Traditional economic activities include slash-and-burn agriculture, fishing, hunting and the collection of Brazil nuts and palm fruit. Traditionally, there were almost no handicraft activities or major cultural expressions at Infierno. In 1987, NCI set aside 3,000 hectares of its land to serve as a communal reserve committed to the conservation of wildlife. By communal agreement, hunting, agriculture and extractive activities were banned in the area. The inhabited area is divided in two by the Tambopata River. Although community members settle on both sides of the river, those who live on the right bank find it difficult to take their produce to the markets in Puerto Maldonado as the main road is located on the left bank. In the same way, although the main port was located close to the centre of the community, it was difficult for the majority of people to transport their produce there. Even so, prior to 1996, Infierno was linked to Puerto Maldonado, the capital city of the Madre de Dios region, via a 19-kilometre road or a two-hour boat ride. Thus the community had access to health facilities, a kindergarten and a primary school. At the end of the 1980s, tourism activity increased in the area. Every day, boats packed with tourists crossed NCI community land and the local people started to consider the possibility of developing similar activities in the community. RFE started operating in 1992 at the Tambopata Research Centre (TRC), located eight hours by boat from Puerto Maldonado, a centre dedicated to research on macaws. In order to complete the trip, RFE tourists needed to stop over for one night and RFE was looking for a suitable campsite along its route. Typically, some TRC staff were hired from the Infierno community, so there was already some contact between the initiative’s participants. Realizing the potential of such a scheme, NCI approached RFE to develop an ecotourism activity that could bring economic benefits to the community. RFE agreed because of the existence of the communal reserve, a primary forest area suited to the development of ecotourism and an ideal stopover for tourists visiting TRC. Against this background, in the 1980s and 1990s, such concepts as sustainable local development and environmental conservation, both of which are key characteristics of the project, were becoming widely promoted and ecotourism was developing as a significant niche market worldwide. In addition, since 1997, the political situation in Peru has become much more stable, making the country more attractive as a tourist destination. Nowadays, Tambopata Natural Reserve is much more accessible, with Puerto Maldonado, the nearest major town, just a 20-minute flight from Cusco, a major Peruvian destination that receives two or three international commercial flights every day. Among the reasons that tourists are increasingly visiting the region is that Madre de Dios is the self-proclaimed “biodiversity capital” of Peru, as it hosts three national areas recognized worldwide: Manu National Park, Bahuaja-Sonene National Park and Tambopata National Reserve.",

    "abstract": "Leadership in Education for African Development (LEAD-link) is a regional network of ten organizations from six sub-Saharan countries (Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia) working in the field of the development of educational management. The network was established in 2003 at a meeting in the United Republic of Tanzania. Each of the member organizations plays an important role in the training of department heads, head teachers and principals in their respective countries. LEAD-link contributes to the development of primary, secondary and teacher education through improved educational management and leadership based on indigenous knowledge systems. Before the creation of LEAD-link, there was an obvious lack of knowledge-sharing, information flow and cooperation between leading educational management institutions in the eastern and southern Africa region. The aim of LEAD-link is to provide a means for like-minded institutions in the region to connect with one another in efforts to address these challenges. In order to realize this aim, the main activities of LEAD-link are to: • exchange staff in order to share experiences and lessons learned; • organize regional conferences and workshops for the dissemination of information and knowledge-sharing; • undertake joint research and consultancy activities; and • develop and promote educational management and leadership based on indigenous knowledge systems. To achieve these goals, each member of LEAD-link has appointed a Local Network Coordinator, who stimulates communication and knowledge exchange between staff members of the organizations. Information and communication technology (ICT) is used as the main facility for efficient, effective com- munication and information-sharing. In particular, the network uses EM E-Office (www.emeoffice.com), a dedicated knowledge portal and communication platform. Prior to the LEAD-link initiative, each of the member organizations was working more or less in isolation with regard to v Costs: To date, US$86,500 have been received from various donors, the most important of which are the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs (US$50,000), Plan Netherlands (US$31,500) and the South Africa-based Shuttleworth Foundation (US$3,000). Development of Educational Management: United Republic of Tanzania 167 other African countries. Several members, however, had strong relations with similar organizations outside the region, including, for example, the Commonwealth Council for Educational Administration and Management (CCEAM); the International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP), France; the International Network of Principals’ Centers (INPC), United States; Interstudie, the Netherlands; the National College for School Leadership (NCSL), United Kingdom; and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE), Canada. In each case, the focus was on the North providing support for the South rather than countries in the South assisting one another. Although there were institutionalized contacts within the sub-Saharan Africa region dedicated to education, none focused exclusively on educational management at either the school or the district level. The Association for the Development of Education in Africa (ADEA), for example, focuses on teacher management, while the Southern African Development Community (SADC) focuses on education policy planning and management for senior officials of ministries of education.",

    "abstract": "With the Amazon Basin, the Atlantic coast and the sub-Andean regions, among others, South America hosts a significant part of the world’s biodiversity. The tropical and subtropical forests also provide products used as traditional medicines by people living in the region. It was considered highly likely, therefore, that novel molecules isolated and characterized from Latin America’s natural riches could form the basis of commercial medicines and thus help to generate resources for self-sustaining regional research efforts. At the time – and to this day – Latin America lacks an institute dedicated to such research activities. To achieve the desired goals, therefore, LANBIO was founded in 1993 as a network of researchers and their institutions, with the aim of promoting research on natural products in Latin America. The novelty of the idea was to create a network of active scientists and their home laboratories in several countries in the region in order to achieve the critical mass of researchers needed for scientific creativity. Beyond any internal or external additional support, the initiative makes diverse laboratory facilities available to any member for natural product research. An active exchange of students among cooperating LANBIO laboratories is also supported, mainly by the International Programme in the Chemical Sciences (IPICS) of Uppsala University, Sweden. Thanks to collaboration among network members, an international patent application that protected the discovery by LANBIO members of a naturally occurring sedative was followed by more patent applications at local and international levels. The intellectual property rights of the patent and patent applications filed provided new funds for the research of the laboratories involved; these funds have been used to provide fellowships and purchase equipment. The patents have also helped to develop relations with local private enterprises. Failures also occurred and difficulties were frequently encountered in filing patent applications and maintaining intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, the existence of the network of scientists has been demonstrated to be the most important aspect for all those participating in the innovation chain, including scientists, commercial partners and intellectual property rights agents. v Costs: LANBIO has received some US$180,000 from various governments, mainly to cover scientists’ salaries, as well as US$130,000 from national sources and US$100,000 from international sources. Sharing Resources, Sharing Knowledge: Uruguay 181 The first patents generated by the LANBIO initiative were filed with international support. Since then, and owing to the fact that there were no funds available at universities in the South to file or protect patents, LANBIO has been actively searching for private support. Cases are presented below to illustrate these activities. They show that the research, carried out through the LANBIO network, was the most productive side of all these endeavours while the behaviour of intellectual property rights (IPR) agents, local or international, and private companies was variable. Higher plants and animals have been living and evolving together for tens of millions of years. Over this long time span, a surprising number of plant molecules have arisen that have different types of actions and regulatory capabilities over the metabolic pathways present in the mammalian brain. For much of the past several thousand years, humankind has relied on plant extracts to treat a wide range of medical conditions, including wounds, infectious diseases and tumours. While almost 60 per cent of the world’s population still relies on plant preparations as its only therapeutic choice, 39 per cent of new pharmaceutical drugs approved in the past ten years have been derived from natural sources. Nevertheless, only a very small proportion of the estimated 250,000 plant species has been systematically explored for novel molecules. Biodiversity, in particular the biodiversity of Latin America, offers great promise for the discovery of molecules with entirely new types of biological action. In this context, natural product research should be considered a meaningful activity in universities in the South and researchers in developing countries should take into consideration the intellectual property rights (IPRs) that could be generated from such research. Besides, natural product research is a multidisciplinary activity involving, among other disciplines, botany, biology, chemistry and pharmacology.  Very few research institutions in the South have the capacity to cover all these activities. Therefore, national and regional cooperation in the South is vital. LANBIO was created to promote natural product research in Latin America. With the Amazon Basin, the Atlantic coast and the sub-Andean regions, South America hosts a significant proportion of the world’s biodiversity. The tropical and subtropical forests also provide products used as traditional medicines by people living in the region. It was thus considered likely that novel molecules isolated and characterized from Latin American flora and fauna could be used to generate resources for additional, self-sustaining research efforts. Complementation of regional natural product research activities and its promotion in less developed areas, together with an important training component, were also reasons for the creation of LANBIO. At the time of its creation in 1993, no IPR protection facilities were available in local universities. One of the main concerns of LANBIO was the protection of the IPRs generated in regional laboratories.",

    "abstract": "A multi-stakeholder participatory planning process to develop media campaigns was applied in two resource management initiatives in the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam. The process was adapted from redesigning methods used to manage change within organizations. The adaptation for use in agriculture is innovative. The first project, named “No Early Spray”, aimed to motivate farmers to test a simple pest management rule. It was carried out in Long An province. The second project, a research-extension initiative called “Three Reductions, Three Gains” (local name Ba Giam Ba Tang), applied an incremental approach to information diffusion to motivate farmers to reduce seed rates, fertilizer rates and the number of pesticide applications. It was carried out in Cantho province. The first media campaign in Long An province resulted in a 53-per cent reduction in insecticide use and no loss in production at the project sites. Within three years, the change had spread to more than one million rice farmers. The “Three Reductions, Three Gains” initiative reached 70 per cent of the farmers at the target sites and resulted in increased yields and improved profits amounting to some US$58 per hectare for farmers in the Mekong Delta by 2003. Farmers reduced seed rates by 10 per cent, nitrogen fertilizer application by 7 per cent and insecticides by 24 per cent. In October 2004, the Agriculture Minister of Viet Nam announced that the provincial governments would implement “Three Reductions, Three Gains” in the whole country starting in the 2004-2005 cropping season. Together, these two case studies have demonstrated that, when planned through a participatory process, the mass media can effectively transfer some elements of knowledge-intensive resource management, especially simple non-sitespecific information, to motivate change. They also highlighted the need to distil information into knowledge products in the form of heuristics, or simple messages, that can be easily communicated to help farmers to make better decisions. The use of heuristics, a concept derived from social psychology, as a means to present a large body of information in a simple form is an innovative approach. Some of the features of the two initiatives that were found to be extremely useful are: developing high-quality partnerships and building social capital, v Costs: For the first initiative, IRRI provided US$10,000 and US$30,000 were provided by local provincial governments. For the second initiative, IRRI provided US$40,000 and provincial governments provided US$320,000. Distilling Scientific Information for Farmers: Viet Nam 191 building project objectives into institutional objectives, using mechanisms to encourage participation and encouraging farmer participatory research (FPR) to facilitate farmers’ evaluation of heuristics. This use of FPR as a form of demonstration and learning tool for farmers is another innovative approach. In the paddy fields of the Mekong Delta in Viet Nam, rice farmers base their decisions as to whether to spray their crops with insecticide on their perception of potential damage and losses that pests might cause. Visible damage to leaves is often perceived to be a serious threat to yields and prompts farmers to spray. Typically, farmers in the Mekong Delta applied three or four insecticide sprays in a season, half of which were targeted at leaf-feeding insects such as the rice leaffolder, a caterpillar, during the early growth stages of the crop (fig. 1). Research carried out at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines showed that these early season sprays have no economic benefit. Indeed, IRRI scientists showed that rice plants are able to compensate for leaf damage that occurs during the early growth stages of the crop. These early sprays, however, cause ecological disruptions to the natural predator-prey balance that favour secondary pests, such as the more damaging brown plant hopper. Figure 1 Whitened tips of growing leaves are diagnostic of the presence of the rice leaffolder caterpillar. In the Mekong Delta, there are some 2.3 million households, most of which earn their living from growing rice on a small scale. However, most farmers use unnecessarily high inputs of seed for direct seeding and fertilizer, based on the perception that the high rates will lead to higher yields. In fact, high seed and high fertilizer rates increase input costs and can lead to higher pest infestations, thus prompting the use of more pesticides. Research has shown that higher seed and fertilizer rates also promote insect fitness, thus making infestations even more visible. On average, farmers sowed 230 kilogrammes of seed per hectare and 102 kilogrammes of nitrogen fertilizer per hectare, while 120 kilogrammes of seed per hectare and 80 kilogrammes of nitrogen fertilizer per hectare would suffice. In addition, the unnecessary inputs have effects on human health, the environment and aquatic food resources. To reach this large population and motivate change is a daunting task requiring a great deal of expense, resources and time. A multi-stakeholder participatory planning process was used to develop a mass-media-based communication campaign to initiate a change in farmer beliefs and insecticide use.",

    "abstract": "In 2001, a study on the “Status of Disaster Preparedness in CDERA Participating States” revealed that floods were the most common natural disaster events, occurring in more than 90 per cent of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) participating States and territories in the five years prior to the start of the Caribbean Disaster Management (CADM) project. In addition, only four of these 16 countries had any plans in place to guide disaster management activities for this hazard. The overall goal of the CADM project, implemented from August 2002 to March 2006, therefore, was to mitigate the damage caused by natural disasters in CDERA participating States and territories, particularly by floods. Three countries – Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago – had recorded high incidences of flooding and, as a result, they all had some flood management procedures in place. Floodhit areas in these three countries, therefore, were chosen for pilot studies. Barbados in particular was selected owing to the socio-economic impact on the area of Speightstown following a number of recorded flood events in 1984, 1994, 1997 and 2004. In addition, the pilot study in Barbados is currently the most advanced, so it forms the main subject of this case study. The main outputs of the CADM project included: • the establishment of regional and national mechanisms for the preparation of hazard maps and community disaster plans; • the establishment and strengthening, through the support of regional and national stakeholders, of a flood-hazard mapping system based primarily on technology transfer, flood simulation and geographic information systems (GISs); • the enhancement of community disaster-management planning through the development of community disaster plans and the training of community members in disaster management planning; and • the improvement of the capacity of the CDERA Disaster Information Warehouse, which now collects and disseminates information in a systematic and timely manner. During the CADM project, both national and regional professionals were trained in flood hazard mapping and community disaster-management planning. Another feature of the project was Caribbean Disaster Management Project: Barbados 17 the collaboration with regional institutions and the efforts made to establish formal partnerships with institutions such as the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH), the University of Technology and the University of the West Indies (UWI) in an attempt to enhance the delivery and sustainability of the project. A study carried out in May 2001, “Status of Disaster Preparedness in CDERA Participating States”, revealed that, in the five previous years, flooding had been the most common hazard in the majority of CDERA participating States and territories (table 1). In addition, only four of the 16 CDERA countries and territories had any flood management procedures in place. Stakeholder discussions following this study resulted in the Caribbean Disaster Management (CADM) project, a four year initiative conceptualized as a plausible disaster reduction initiative to mitigate flood hazard damage in all CDERA participating States and territories. To facilitate the design and the development of the CADM project, a Japanese delegation, including representatives from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), visited the Caribbean in July and December 2001 and two workshops were held to develop the project proposal. Workshop participants were drawn from national disaster offices and national planning, water resources and drainage departments in the project countries and included experts from the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology, CDERA and UWI.",

    "abstract": "The general objective of the project was to develop an integrated evaluation of the multi-hazard risks for the territory of the municipality of Mariel in northwestern Cuba by assessing the vulnerability of the area based on physical, social and environmental factors. The analysis, undertaken by staff of the National Centre for Seismological Research (CENAIS) with the collaboration of specialists from the Institute of Geophysics and Astronomy, was the first of its kind to be undertaken at the municipality level in Cuba. The main results achieved were: • an environmental diagnosis for pre-disaster scenario characterization and risk management; • an assessment of the natural hazards and the development of a multi-hazard zonation map; • seismic microzonation studies of the main urban area of the municipality; • an assessment of the risks from technological developments such as chemical plants and environmental pollution; • a thorough evaluation of vulnerability and risk; and • the production of a series of recommendations for disaster prevention and mitigation. Cuba consists of 169 municipalities classified as rural, semi-rural or urbanized. Many of these municipalities are subject to various natural and man-made hazards and are also affected by environmental degradation and pollution. This is the case regarding the coastal municipality of Mariel, located in northwest Cuba less than 50 kilometres west of Havana. The territory of the municipality of Mariel covers 270 square kilometres and is home to more than 42,000 inhabitants. Of this population, 75 per cent live in urban areas and 25 per cent in rural areas. Mariel, the main town within the municipality, is home to 17,300 people and has a population density of more than 3,000 inhabitants per square kilometre. In the municipality as a whole, there are 30 settlements of more than 200 inhabitants, of which six are urban and 24 are rural. Although this gives the municipality a semi-rural character, the area also hosts a significant industrial sector, including a thermoelectric plant and a cement factory as well as a busy port. Several of the local industrial plants, including the thermoelectric plant and the cement factory, are known to cause pollution and have contributed to the degradation of the urban environment of the town of Mariel, with negative consequences for both human health and the natural environment. The territory of the municipality also has a high susceptibility to geological and hydrometeorological natural hazards, including landslides, tropical cyclones, Evaluating Risks from Natural Hazards: Cuba 31 local severe storms, coastal floods and earthquakes of a moderate magnitude. As a result of these hazards and because of the need to improve local contingency plans, the authorities of the municipality and the National Staff for Civil Defence sponsored the initiative described in this case study.",

    "abstract": "Cuba, like many other Caribbean countries, is at risk from a variety of potential natural disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, hurricanes and landslides. Scientists at the National Centre for Seismological Research (CENAIS) have developed a seven-point methodology for studying pre-disaster scenarios. Among these points are a historical analysis of the location; the estimation of different hazards; an evaluation of the vulnerability of the population and important infrastructure, including lines of communication and health services; and a weighting of vulnerability factors. Together, these analyses allow the researchers to take a holistic view of risk and then to raise the awareness of the local population. Projects carried out in two municipalities in eastern Cuba and one in Nicaragua have helped to refine the methodology used to study pre-disaster scenarios. Project reports, which include a series of mitigation recommendations, are now in the hands of local authorities and decision-makers. Early indications are that, by implementing the recommendations resulting from the predisaster scenario studies, loss of life and property can be significantly reduced or avoided in a disaster situation. Over the past 100 years, natural disasters have caused increasing human and economic losses. For the major part of the twentieth century, it can be demonstrated that decision-makers and the strategies that they applied to mitigate natural disasters were not effective, especially in the poorest, less developed countries. People in these developing countries, therefore, were often the most vulnerable in the face of natural disasters, with more lives lost and more damage done to livelihoods. Following such disasters, national economies take a long time to recover. Recurrent natural disasters, whether caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, landslides or volcanic eruptions, therefore, inhibit national development. Using modern scientific techniques, however, including advanced information technologies together with contributions from the social sciences, can help to reduce the impact of the natural and anthropogenic disasters and to improve the sustainable development of societies. In the 1980s, devastating earthquakes in several developing countries, including Mexico (1985), El Salvador (1986) and Armenia (1988), demonstrated the necessity for studying the impact of earthquakes in Cuba, which lies in a seismically active zone. Since then, seismological research has been supported by the Government of Cuba. Studies of seismic vulnerability have been carried out and plans have been drawn up to protect against such natural catastrophes. Studying Pre-disaster Scenarios: Cuba 47 The International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, 1990-1999, designated by the United Nations, provided further impetus for the study of seismology in Cuba. During this period, the National Centre for Seismological Research (CENAIS) was created. The national seismological network, which monitors tremors in the Earth’s crust across the country, was also updated and improved. In addition, the National Network of Observations for the Estimation of Seismic Hazards was established and a programme of studies on the prevention and mitigation of seismic disasters was initiated, with the recommendations being implemented in the provinces of Granma, Holguin and Santiago de Cuba. Since 2000, the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction has provided countries such as Cuba with new challenges that must be met in order to decrease the human death toll from, and reduce the adverse environmental and economic impact of, natural disasters and to guarantee sustainable development. Fortunately, the reality in Cuba is very different from the reality in many other countries in the Caribbean and Latin America region because the political will exists to mitigate disasters and a country-wide programme of protecting human lives and resources has been implemented. Studies of pre-disaster scenarios in Cuba constitute the main component of a disaster prevention strategy based on the management of risk at the local level.",

    "abstract": "By observing the sea, the sky or animal behaviour, early Amerindian populations and, later, black slave communities in the Caribbean were able, to some degree, to foretell the arrival of such natural disasters as hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Even so, a series of natural disasters that affected the region caused many deaths in the 1700s, 1800s and early 1900s. Fortunately, more sophisticated forecasting techniques are available nowadays. In the French West Indies (which includes the island of Martinique and the Guadeloupe archipelago, the focus of this case study), technical progress has enabled considerable improvements to be made in terms of disaster prevention; these improvements have been supported by recent legislation. This case study reviews the history of natural disasters in the French West Indies and the effectiveness of legislative and other efforts to mitigate the risks of future natural disasters. Although public guidance and support seem to be optimal, some aspects of national disaster prevention plans warrant further examination. These include the available disaster prevention infrastructure of outlying areas and the need for more collective awareness with respect to risks. Natural disasters occur regularly in the Caribbean region.  The first recorded hurricanes in Martinique and Guadeloupe date back to 1635 and 1655, respectively. Since then, more than 100 severe weather phenomena have whirled through or close to the two islands, causing considerable damage. For example, hurricanes and tropical storms ravaged Martinique on 4 September 1713, 13 August 1766, 11 October 1780, 18 August 1891, 13 August 1993 and 17 November 1999, causing wide-scale destruction and death. Indeed, chroniclers of the early events were so impressed by the violence of the phenomena that they did not hesitate to amplify them, often rendering them even more dramatic than the actual event (fig. 1). The first photographs taken in the aftermath of severe meteorological events were produced at the end of the nineteenth century and often confirmed Figure 1 Etching of the effects of the hurricane that hit the French West Indies in October 1780. the apocalyptic visions of the official chroniclers (fig. 2). Guadeloupe has faced a similar series of storms. Hurricanes occurring on 15 August 1766, 12 September 1928, 27 September 1966, 29 August 1979 and 13 September 1989 caused much damage. However, they did not leave the same impression in the minds of the public. Every Guadeloupian would claim that Hurricane Hugo in 1989 was the most violent meteorological event of the twentieth century. In fact, the hurricane of September 1928 killed more than 1,200 people and left the island in such a dilapidated state that most reporters believed that it would never be able to recover (fig. 3). Despite their violence and frequent recurrence, severe meteorological phenomena have never had the same destructive capacity as the islands’ volcanoes. In 1976, the Guadeloupe archipelago suffered from a spell of volcanic activity that caused the evacuation of the town of Basse Terre and a portion of Saint Claude. However, this did not compare to the dramatic events of 8 May 1902 when the eruption of Mount Pelée destroyed the entire city of Saint-Pierre, Martinique. According to the reports of some eyewitnesses, who were posted on hilltops Learning Lessons from History: French West Indies 61 Figure 3 A house in Pointe-à-Pitre blown off its foundations by the hurricane that hit Guadeloupe in 1928. Figure 2 An early photograph of the destruction caused by a hurricane that hit Martinique in 1891. The image shows the complete destruction of the Fortde-France covered market. around the city some two kilometres from the city centre, people’s clothes lit up in flames when hot ash poured out of the volcano. Scientists estimated that the air temperature reached 900 degrees centigrade in the centre of Saint-Pierre and almost 100 degrees centigrade within a radius of two to three kilometres of the city centre. This explains the fact that, in addition to the 28,000 victims recorded in the eruption, 2,000 additional deaths occurred in the following months. Although Mount Pelée erupted again in 1929, there were no victims since the region was almost deserted and the eruption was less intense. Earthquakes are also a formidable source of destruction in the region. More than 200 earthquakes of a magnitude of three or greater on the Richter scale have been recorded over the past 300 years in Martinique and Guadeloupe. The two most violent events were those of 11 January 1839 in Martinique and 8 February 1843 in Guadeloupe. The Martinique earthquake caused 400 fatalities, injured another 1,000 people and destroyed almost half of Fort-de-France, the main town. Likewise, on Guadeloupe, the major town of Pointe-à-Pitre was almost entirely destroyed. Official estimates declared that 3,000 people had been killed and 1,800 had been injured. According to historical research, this earthquake was the most violent ever recorded in the French Caribbean. Earthquakes continue to affect the region, as evidenced by a January 2005 tremor that shook all of the Iles des Saintes, a group of satellite islands of Guadeloupe, destroying one third of the islands’ dwellings. Fortunately, only one person was killed during this quake. Earthquakes can be accompanied by tsunamis. During the past three centuries, Martinique and Guadeloupe have been hit by more than a dozen such tidal waves: on 1 November 1755, 30 November 1823, 30 November 1824, 26 July 1837, 18 November 1867, 5 May 1901, in December 1901 and in March and April 1902, on 6 May 1902, 30 August 1902 and 24 July 1939. The effects of some of these events were negligible; therefore, good records do not exist. Even so, the two islands are vulnerable to future tsunamis owing to the presence of Kick’em Jenny, an active submerged volcano off the coast of Grenada, and the presence of an unstable mass of rock caused by a major fault in the Cumbre Vieja mountain range of La Palma, one of the Canary Islands. Many scientists believe that the western slope of the island is on the verge of collapsing into the sea. If it does so, it is predicted that a massive tsunami will sweep westwards across the Atlantic Ocean towards the Caribbean.",

    "abstract": "Land use in Jamaica is changing rapidly in order to meet the economic and housing needs of the growing population. The high incidence of hydrogeological disasters in the last decade, including landslides and flooding, is symptomatic of this change (see table 1). The project, “Living with Natural Hazards in Jamaica”, is a proactive response to managing the risks posed by such natural hazards. Although focused on Jamaica, this initiative is designed to serve the entire Caribbean region, with the aim of demonstrating the importance of geological knowledge to forecast, avoid and mitigate natural hazards in small island developing States (SIDS). The important elements of the project are: • a website: Geology for Natural Hazard Loss-reduction and Environmental Management in the Caribbean (see www.mona.uwi.edu/uds). The main purpose of this Caribbean-focused website is to provide scientific information, data sources and references that will enable a better understanding of the active processes leading to natural disasters and how people interact with their environment; • a four-week summer training course on “Analysis and Management of Natural Hazards and Risks” (see www.mona.uwi.edu/ uds/GEOHAZARDS_2001/ GEOHAZ2001-CONTENTS.html) geared towards students and disaster professionals from within and beyond the Caribbean region; • research into natural hazards, particularly landslide processes, neotectonics (a technique used to predict earthquakes that involves measuring the rate of slippage of landmarks along faults) and sediment-water flooding and coastal-water flooding; • the rapid assessment of natural disaster events; • the publication and presentation of research results in scientific journals and at local, regional and international conferences and seminars and, based on this research, the preparation of hazard maps; and • the presentation of research findings in magazines and other news media. Until 1986, the village of Preston in the Parish of St. Mary, north of the capital city, Kingston, was an active farming community. Slope movements in and around the village following heavy rainfall during May and June of that year caused the widespread development of fissures, slumping and subsidence, forcing residents to abandon their homes and farmland. Today, Preston is a ghost town. The overall public reaction to this event was perhaps best summed up in an editorial in the leading newspaper of Jamaica, the Daily Gleaner, of 18 May 1986, which described it as the “St. Living with Natural Hazards: Jamaica 71 Mary Mystery”, suggesting that there was no explanation for this phenomenon. However, the causes of this misfortune for the residents of Preston were landslides, which are an all-too-real and common geological hazard not only in Jamaica but also in the wider Caribbean. In Jamaica, Preston is not the only place that has been affected by landslides in recent years. The rainstorm of 3-4 January 1998, for example, triggered widespread landslides and related flooding in the Rio Grande Valley of Portland in the northeast of the island, resulting in direct losses estimated by the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) and the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) at some US$8 million. The frequency of such hydrogeological natural hazard events in Jamaica, approximately one in every four years during the last 50 years, makes it abundantly clear that natural hazard events are widespread and costly (table 1). Event Damage (estimated cost in US$) Flood rains Cost of repairs to damaged and destroyed road May-June 1986 network: US$16 million. Village of Preston, St. Mary, destroyed; 17 families displaced; replacement cost in 1986: US$273,000. Hurricane Gilbert Approximately 60 per cent of the island water facilities 8-19 September 1988 damaged; repair costs estimated at US$10 million. Boar River water supply pipeline damaged. Repairs to island road network estimated at US$19.3 million. 478 landslides along 108 km of roads in northwestern St. Andrew (4 per cent of the total road system of the island) blocked by landslides. Landslides delivered an estimated 20,000 m3 of sediment to rivers. Flood rains Island-wide damage estimated at US$30 million. 21-22 May 1991 Bog Walk Gorge road blocked by a landslide, forcing it to remain closed for more than six months. Tropical storm Gordon Approximately 241 km, or 2.3 per cent of the total 11-12 November 1994 road network of Jamaica, damaged; cost:  US$2 million. Damage to water systems estimated at $834,000. Flood rains Total damage approximately US$8 million. 3-4 January 1998 Portland Period from 1986 to 1998 Total: Approximately US$86.25 million Table 1 Damage to infrastructure caused by some of the landslide and flooding events occurring during the period from 1986 to 1998 in Jamaica. The vulnerability of Jamaica to multiple hazards is one of the main threats to the sustainable development of the country. However, this situation could be avoided because the causes of the majority of natural hazards occurring in Jamaica are relatively well understood. The high incidence of natural hazards in Jamaica is caused by a combination of geological, geophysical and geographical factors (table 2). For example, the island is located in the track of Atlantic hurricanes and also within a seismically active plate boundary zone. Geologically young landforms with steep hillsides are characteristic. As a consequence, the hazards that affect the island most frequently are landslides and flooding. These hazards are important because of their frequency, associated loss of life, disruption of socio-economic activities and their effect on the built and natural environment. Landslides account for most of the natural disasters that have occurred on the island during the last decade and continue to present risks to life and property (fig. 1). The high incidence of landslides and flooding is also symptomatic of changing land use. In Jamaica, landslides and floods are a recurring cause of death and injury and have damaged and destroyed rural settlements, schools, public and private property, roads, bridges, culverts, retaining walls, agricultural land and crops, water pipelines, electricity transmission lines and submarine cables. In addition, slopes that have been denuded by landslides suffer from accelerated soil erosion. The indirect economic costs of such natural disasters, therefore, can be several orders of magnitude higher than the direct costs. Natural hazard events become natural disasters when geological knowledge is not sufficiently considered in policy decisions on land use and also partly because of poor communication between experts, decision-makers, communities and individuals. Losses and risks from recurrent natural hazard events might be reduced and/or avoided if scientific data on the physical environment in which people live were made available freely and openly to all concerned. It is possible to predict natural hazard events with a fair degree of reliability, a fact that makes natural hazards amenable to measures directed at avoidance and/or prevention. Societies need practical and timely information that may help them to evaluate whether or not particular hazards threaten their lives, economic activities and property and to help them to decide how to respond proactively to hazardous situations. When it comes to minimizing losses from natural hazards, however, Jamaica can be described as “data-rich but information-poor”. There is a great deal of environmental and geological data available in scientific publications and reports but such information is not readily available to land-use planners or the general public. As a result, public funds are often spent on re-investigating particular hazards.

    "abstract": "In many tropical seas, coral reefs play a vital role not only in providing livelihoods for local fishermen and tour operators but also in shoreline protection. Healthy reefs, for example, can reduce the impact of natural hazards such as cyclones and tsunamis. However, owing to increased pressure and overexploitation from coastal communities as well as other environmental factors such as increased pollution and rising sea temperatures, many coral reefs are deteriorating. A project was undertaken by scientists from the Institut Halieutique et des Sciences Marines of the University of Toliara and the Department of Animal Biology of the University of Antananarivo to assess the possibility of transplanting corals from an area of healthy reef to a degraded area and to determine the longterm effects of such transplantation on the coral and associated reef fauna, including various species of fish. The first corals were transplanted onto an area of degraded inner reef off the southwest coast of Madagascar in September 2003. A total of 84 coral colonies belonging to the Acroporidae, Agaricidae, Faviidae, Pocilloporidae and Poritidae families were transplanted using either special cement or nylon strings to attach them to natural substrates on the degraded reef. Three months after transplantation, 80 per cent of the corals had survived. Twelve months later, 72 per cent of the corals had survived at one site, Jardin des Roses, while at the Fanemotsa study site, the survival rate of the transplanted corals was 52.5 per cent. Several species of fish were also attracted back to the study sites, including indicator species for healthy reefs. Among these fish are those species sought after by local fishermen. Although Madagascar is one of the largest islands in the world, with a coastline of about 6,000 kilometres, it shares many problems with small island developing States (SIDS). The coral reefs of Madagascar cover an area of 2,000 square kilometres and play a vital role in supporting the livelihoods of numerous coastal communities. Increasing population and environmental pressures, however, are contributing to the degradation of marine and coastal ecosystems. In particular, fragile coral reef communities are threatened. Such a loss of this critical biodiversity will have severe economic consequences for local fisheries and tour operators as well as reducing the protection afforded to the shoreline by a thriving reef. In Madagascar, the reef systems are located along the southwest coast, off the Toliara region. The Great Barrier of Toliara and its fringing reefs, including Ifaty, 25 kilometres from Toliara, are influenced by two large rivers: the Fiherenana to the north and the Onilahy to the south. The deposition of sediments by these Restoring Coral Reefs: Madagascar 89 rivers has seriously damaged the reefs and seagrass beds are now taking over. Surveys carried out in 2002 estimated that the cover of live coral on the flat upper parts of the Great Barrier Reef and the Ifaty fringing reef was 24 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, whereas coral cover was recorded as 45 per cent and 42 per cent, respectively, on the outer slopes. In addition, 15 per cent of the dead coral was covered with algal turf. This led scientists to correlate an episode of coral bleaching (i.e., death) with elevated sea temperatures experienced in 1988. Owing to these and other pressures, rehabilitation and restoration of degraded coral reefs are necessary to save this fragile ecosystem. Coral reef rehabilitation can contribute to the sound management of the reef ecosystem in general and has been successfully accomplished in several areas, including the Gulf of Eilat, Israel; Bamburi-Shanzu lagoon, Kenya; Duka Bay and Medina in the southern Philippines; and Tutia Reef in the Marine Protected Area of the United Republic of Tanzania. This study reports on the first experimental restoration of degraded coral reefs in Madagascar. The main objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the techniques used for fixing the corals to the natural substrates (in this case, dead coral) and to quantify the impact of the transplanted coral on the local ecosystem and the socio-economic condition of the local community.",

    "abstract": "Mauritius, which covers an area of 1,865 square kilometres, lies in the Indian Ocean some 900 kilometres off the east coast of Madagascar. A significant area of the island’s coastal zone, including its lagoons and the islets and coral reefs around the mainland, does not rise more than 32 metres above sea level.  Areas lying within this range are either directly or indirectly susceptible to various types of natural or anthropogenic disasters. Such land is prone to seawater inundations and erosion from tsunamis and cyclones while the lagoons are prone to sedimentation and erosion. Furthermore, the lagoon ecosystems and the coastal regions are also at risk from algal blooms, invasions of poisonous jellyfish, oil spills and other pollution hazards. These areas are also prone to floods, landslides, droughts, heat waves or periods of cold weather, forest fires and other possible calamities, including volcanic eruptions. Satellite imagery coupled with a Geographic Information System (GIS) can be used to study the potential impact of disasters and, through proper modelling and planning, to develop appropriate mitigation measures regarding these disasters. Research efforts at the University of Mauritius have been targeted towards creating models based on various scenarios aimed at developing an integrated disaster-management and information system for handling a range of disasters, including cyclones, tsunamis and flood inundation, erosion and landslides, and oil spills. Disasters are inevitable; it is not a question of if the next one will occur but when it will occur.  In addition, recent years have seen increases in the frequency of disasters, the damage they cause and the cost of the response, especially in terms of relief and rehabilitation efforts. For example, during the first decade of the twentieth century, nine disasters were recorded whereas 4,000 disasters were recorded during the final decade of the century. As a result, 1990-1999 was designated as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) by the United Nations. This period also witnessed a three-fold increase in the number of large natural disasters compared to 1960-1969, and, in 1998, more major natural disasters occurred than in any other year on record.  Between 1971 and 1995, an average of more than 130,000 people were killed each year owing to natural disasters while more than 140 million people suffered from injuries, homelessness and other adverse consequences. Indeed, during each year of the IDNDR, natural disasters resulted in the loss of life of some 128,000 people and adversely affected an average of another 136 million each year. Recent unfortunate events around the world have again brought into sharp focus the need to prepare societies to face the challenges posed by various disasters. It has become crucial for all nations to formulate policies and to develop infra Integrating Disaster-management Information: Mauritius 101 structure and control systems that minimize the threat to human lives and resources. Society must not only forge effective plans for disaster prevention, mitigation and management but also build the necessary infrastructure to ensure an effective response. Disasters can be classified in several ways. One distinction is that between man-made, or anthropogenic, disasters and natural disasters. Another classifica tion relates to the main controlling factors leading to a disaster, which may be meteorological, geological, ecological, technological or even extraterrestrial. Descriptions and examples of various types of disasters that threaten societies and for which there is a need to plan preventive measures and disseminate information widely are presented in table 1. Mauritius is prone to many of the disaster types listed in this table.

Table 1 Classification of disasters. Another useful distinction that can be made between disasters relates to the duration of their impact and the time needed for forewarning. The timescales of disasters differ from a few seconds in the case of earthquakes, for example, to hours for cyclones, days for floods and months or even years for droughts. While natural disasters occur on all continents, susceptibility differs from one area to another.  Table 2 provides global statistics on the frequency of natural disasters and the associated human losses for the period from 1947 to 1980, while details of their distribution are given in table 3. For example, cyclones and hurricanes (which accounted for 40.8 per cent of fatalities), earthquakes (36.8 per cent) and floods (15.9 per cent) were the most devastating disasters while tsunamis accounted for just 0.4 per cent of the fatalities. During this period,  86.2 per cent of the fatalities occurred on the Asian continent. This data can be compared to data from more recent natural disasters. For example, the earthquake that occurred in Pakistan in October 2005 caused more than 30,000 fatalities, while the 9.0-magnitude earthquake of December 2004 Disaster Type Description Examples Biological This type of disaster typically arises as a • Biological warfare; result of negligence in the maintenance • Disease epidemics in domestic of health and hygiene practices by those animals  and wildlife; handling food and improper use of materials • Food poisoning; used to prepare food or quarantine checks • Pest and disease at international borders. outbreaks in crops; • Invasions of non-native organisms.

The 1994 Yokohama Message that derived from the World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction noted that “Disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness are better than disaster response in achieving the goals and objectives of the Decade. Disaster response alone is not sufficient, as it yields only temporary results at a very high cost. We have followed this limited approach for too long. This has been further demonstrated by the recent focus on response to complex emergencies, which, although compelling, should not divert from pursuing a comprehensive approach. Prevention contributes to lasting improvement in safety and is essential to integrated disaster management.” The Yokohama Message went on to state that “Regional and international cooperation will significantly enhance our ability to achieve real progress in mitigating disasters through the transfer of technology and the sharing of information and joint disaster prevention and mitigation activities.  Bilateral and multilateral assistance and financial resources should be mobilized to support these efforts.” The Yokohama Message further noted that “The information, knowledge and some of the technology necessary to reduce the effects of natural disasters can be available in many cases at low cost and should be applied. Appropriate technology and data, with the corresponding training, should be made available to all freely and in a timely manner, particularly to developing countries.” Although there has been a dramatic increase in the magnitude and frequency of disasters over recent decades, there has also been a dramatic increase in the technical capabilities to mitigate them. Technological breakthroughs in information technology, telecommunications and geomatics have led to their increasing use in disaster management and mitigation (DMM).  Such geomatic tools as remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GISs) and global positioning systems (GPSs) can be successfully deployed in DMM programmes only when detailed knowledge is obtained about the expected frequency, character and magnitude of hazard events in an area. GIS provides a powerful tool for collecting, storing, retrieving, transforming and displaying spatial data. It also allows scientists to combine different kinds of data in models that can be used during different stages of disaster management. At the University of Mauritius, remote sensing techniques have been combined using GIS and GPS tools into an integrated platform known as the disaster-management information system (DMIS). The DMIS has been developed as a strategy for disaster management and a comprehensive framework for monitoring, assessing and mitigating disasters. DMIS analyses can also identify gaps in current practices Integrating Disaster-management Information: Mauritius 105 and recommend appropriate strategies for disaster management using these technologies. Preliminary results obtained from the use of these technologies within the DMIS have been obtained for Mauritius by studying zones that are potentially at risk from floods, landslides, oil spills, storm surges and tsunamis.",

    "abstract": "The island of Mauritius is constantly threatened by the adverse impact of tropical weather systems, particularly tropical cyclones that historically have brought unprecedented hardships to its economy and population. Dina, a very intense tropical cyclone, threatened both the islands of Rodrigues and Mauritius in January 2002. In order to avoid any loss of life and destruction of property, Mauritius Meteorological Services (MMS) advised people to take all necessary precautions. Both islands suffered continuously from cyclonic gusts, associated with Dina, over long periods, varying from 10 to 20 hours. In addition, torrential rains lashed the islands for more than six hours and there were flash floods in many areas. However, timely warnings issued by MMS using the current four-tier cyclone warning system – a series of warnings based on the proximity and expected severity of the arriving storm – allowed people to protect their properties before proceeding to sheltered buildings. Thanks to the reputation of MMS, which has gained the respect of the public, people obeyed the warnings to the letter. Although significant damage was caused to the environment and infrastructure, many properties were saved and loss of life was kept to a minimum. Mauritius has been issuing adverse weather warnings to its population through various means for more than a century.  Initially, when a storm was imminent, canon shots were used to inform ships in the harbour that they should move out into the open sea.  Also, flags were raised on Signal Mountain, which rises above the capital, Port Louis, to warn the population. With the advent of new communication facilities, starting with telegraphy in the 1870s, the Royal Alfred Observatory, the institution formerly responsible for weather information, established a Weather and Storm Signal Service. This involved sending daily weather information to railway stations and post offices where it was displayed for the general public. Whenever the island was under threat from a cyclone, additional special warnings were issued.  However, people living in remote places had difficulty accessing such information in a timely manner. Such cyclone warning systems were continuously developed and fine-tuned over time until a three-tier system was established in the mid-1900s. Under this three-tier system, additional stakeholders, including the police force, became involved and more precise information was disseminated whenever available. However, an assessment of the warning system indicated that it could be further improved. For example, the warning sys Managing Tropical Cyclones: Mauritius 121 tem did not fully take into consideration the changing exposure and vulnerability of the island of Mauritius and did not meet the requirements and abilities of those for whom the warnings were intended, especially those people living in rural areas.  In particular, the system did not convey any degree of urgency to individuals and, as a result, people’s responses to the warnings were not satisfactory.  In addition, there was no legal framework in place to ensure that the population heeded these warnings.",

    "abstract": "Prior to 2000, disaster management activities in the Pacific region were mainly sponsored by large international agencies and were typically focused on disaster preparedness, response and immediate postdisaster relief. In 1996, the Pacific Leaders Forum decided to place responsibility for the coordination of such activities with the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) (now the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission). A report commissioned for SOPAC in 2000 recommended the establishment of a disaster management unit (DMU) and the application of risk management principles and practices for disaster risk reduction and disaster management. A disaster risk management (comprising disaster risk reduction and disaster management) tool, designated Comprehensive Hazard and Risk Management (CHARM), was developed and piloted and is now being applied in many of the 16 small island developing States (SIDS) in the Pacific. It soon became obvious, however, that SIDS were failing to institutionalize the new disaster risk management principles and practices at the national level and that the developing disaster risk management programmes were not being appropriately integrated and coordinated with sustainable development, poverty alleviation and environmental management policies and programmes. Accordingly, in 2002, SOPAC established a high-level advocacy team (HLAT) with the objective of obtaining the highest level of national commitment to, and support for, the integration of disaster risk management strategies into national development policies and plans. The HLAT consults and advocates with relevant in-country leaders, senior bureaucrats and other stakeholders (including donor representatives) on the introduction and implementation of comprehensive and integrated risk management policies and programmes designed to reduce vulnerability, enhance community resilience and assist in achieving sustainable development. During 2004, the HLAT also participated in the development of a Pacific regional paper for the January 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction. Following this conference and its output document, “Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters”, the HLAT also facilitated the process of developing the counterpart Pacific regional framework, “An Investment for Sustainable Development in Pacific Island Countries: Disaster Risk Reduction and Disaster Management: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters: A Framework for Action 2005-2015”. The establishment and work of the SOPAC HLAT constitute a major regional innovation in assisting in the implementation of national disaster risk reduction and disaster-management programmes. The team has also developed a new concept that integrates disaster risk reduction with disaster management. Advocacy for Disaster Risk Management: Pacific Islands 129 With the endorsement of the new Pacific regional framework by the Pacific Leaders Forum at its meeting in Madang, Papua New Guinea, in October 2005, the work of the team will enter a new phase. In recognition of the regional need to reduce the impact of disasters and in the interest of promoting sustainable development, the Pacific Leaders Forum adopted a vision statement at its meeting in Madang, Papua New Guinea, in 1995: “Vulnerability to the effects of natural hazards, environmental damage and other threats will be overcome”. The vulnerability of SIDS, such as those in the Pacific Ocean, to natural hazards is well documented. Their capacity to reduce this vulnerability is affected by a number of factors, including political will, problems with policy coordination, the relatively low capability of the public sector and a limited resource base. In addition, the tools available to such States to assist them in reducing this vulnerability have largely been the outcomes of studies undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s under the auspices of such regional agencies as the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) and the Pacific Islands Development Programme, with their emphasis on structural disaster mitigation and non-structural disaster preparedness programmes. As a result, disaster reduction activities in the Pacific have generally followed the traditional approach in focusing primarily on natural hazards and on developing capacity for preparedness and response to events. This was the approach of early internationally sponsored disaster management programmes, which assisted many of these States in developing national legislation and national and local disaster management plans and which supported the establishment of national disaster management offices (NDMOs) as key agencies. However, these activities have generally gained only limited support from national governments and donor organizations, while the agencies themselves often have insufficient resources and are unable to secure inter-agency support. In many cases, the resulting disaster management plans themselves were the product of inadequate inter-agency consultation and were under-resourced and rarely exercised or reviewed. There have been a number of instances in which existing disaster management arrangements and plans have proved to be inadequate in practice, to have been ineffectively applied or to have simply been ignored in Government and community responses to disaster events. The effectiveness of many of the NDMOs in this role also tended to be limited by their lack of political prominence and inter-agency contact. Allocation to an inappropriate ministerial portfolio, inadequate and junior-level staffing and prior ineffective performance were often among the factors that con tributed to this lack of effectiveness. This resulted in the NDMOs often being excluded from the mainstream decisionmaking process and working in isolation (the “silo” phenomenon, not unknown elsewhere in respect to specialist disaster management agencies). It had become apparent that continuing with this bottom-up in-country approach to introducing new practices and processes, and hoping to influence senior decision-makers through an advocacy function using the same arrangements would not achieve the desired programme outcomes. While a report on regional activities during the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, 1990-2000, suggested that “In all respects, there has been a significant and purposeful shift from disaster response, relief and rehabilitation – that is, the post-disaster phase – towards planning, mitigation and disaster reduction in the pre-disaster phase”, the same report highlighted heightened vulnerability to natural disasters in many Pacific Island countries. In consequence, levels of community vulnerability in many countries of the region did not decrease significantly during the Decade. Clearly, a new approach was needed if the vision of the Pacific Leaders Forum was to be achieved. In 1996, the South Pacific Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) (now the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission) accepted the responsibility for regional disaster management activities on behalf of the Pacific Leaders Forum. This responsibility was effectively transferred to SOPAC from other regional agencies in 2000. SOPAC itself was established in 1972 as a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) regional project for the assessment of deep-sea minerals and hydrocarbon deposits in the Pacific. It is now a major intergovernmental regional organization with a membership of 16 island States and territories (plus Australia and New Zealand) dedicated to providing geological services to promote sustainable development in the region. It is a member of the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP) and, in recent years, its mandate has been extended to include coastal protection and management, water, sanitation and energy. The SOPAC Governing Council includes high-level national representation, often at the ministerial or departmental head level. This feature of the governance of SOPAC has proved to have important benefits for the advocacy programme. As a result of a study commissioned by SOPAC and published in 2000, a small disaster management unit (DMU) was established within SOPAC. The SOPAC study identified a need to replace the conventional disaster management model, with its focus on response and recovery, with “a more holistic approach, wherein the processes of hazard identification and mitigation, community preparedness, integrated response effort, and recovery are planned for and undertaken contiguously within a risk management context”. Advocacy for Disaster Risk Management: Pacific Islands 131 The “risk management context” referred to in the document derived from work that had been undertaken in Australia, at the request of the then National Emergency Management Committee, to adapt a recently adopted national risk management standard (Australia/New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 4360:1995 – Risk Management) to emergency and disaster management requirements. The DMU of SOPAC undertook the development of a draft disaster management manual based on the risk management approach, which was then piloted during inter-agency workshops in Kiribati, Tonga and Vanuatu organized by NDMOs and facilitated by the DMU. The manual was subsequently published by SOPAC as Regional Comprehensive Hazard and Risk Management (CHARM) – Guidelines for Pacific Island Countries in 2002. CHARM has now been endorsed by a number of national governments in the region and is being progressively adopted and applied in the remainder, with workshops and other assistance being provided by SOPAC and donor agencies. The SOPAC study recommended that the DMU undertake advocacy functions to promote the benefits of risk management within national development strategies. In February 2001, a regional workshop was held in Fiji to develop a strategy for implementing the recommendation. Subsequent in-country CHARM workshops have contained an advocacy element involving high-level briefings and discussions with ministers and senior officials. However, experience with the model for the new CHARM risk management process was revealing some inadequacies in the model itself. The standard on which the model had been based was designed primarily for use by single organizations in managing risks specific to these organizations (the context). In adapting the model for the basic AS/NZS 4360 risk management process, little emphasis was given to the full implications of the multi-organizational, multiple-risk context of the disaster management task, in particular, the resultant needs for high-level political direction and for extensive inter-agency consultation and coordination. In addition, there proved to be a difficulty with the risk treatments promoted in CHARM, which tended to emphasize the 20-year-old linear paradigm of “prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery (PPRR)” as the primary treatments for disaster risk. This approach tends to de-emphasize the importance of the AS/NZS 4360 Standard’s risk treatment options of risk avoidance, reducing likelihood, reducing consequence, risk transfer and risk retention. (Risk retention involves planning and preparedness for treating residual risk.) The PPRR approach also seemed to some to imply a claim for ownership of the national risk management process by disaster managers. It became evident to SOPAC, therefore, that while disaster management specialists needed to provide input into all the steps in the sustainable-development risk management process, their primary responsibility lay in the area of risk retention treatments, i.e., planning and preparedness for the management of those residual risks that were not amenable to appropriate treatment through other options. However, these two problems – the first concerned primarily with delivery mechanisms for the DMU programme, the second with a perceived fault in the programme’s process model – fed into but were rapidly overtaken by a more fundamental problem: the broader relationship between the DMU programme and other regional and national programmes. The origin of the DMU organization and programme lay in the original 2000 SOPAC “Risk Management, Institutional Strengthening and Capacity-building” study, the primary goal of which was “to strengthen national disaster management programming capacities”. The study recognized NDMOs as the primary institutions that required strengthening and capacity-building, and disaster management programming was construed largely in terms of the traditional PPRR paradigm. As the CHARM programme rolled out in 2001-2002, however, concerns were raised over the validity of some of the assumptions and directions of the SOPAC study. In particular, the CHARM workshops highlighted the fact that the responsibility for risk management in the whole range of risks that bear on sustainable development lies beyond the remit of NDMOs and even of the ministries to which such offices are assigned. During the same period, SOPAC itself had been asked by the Pacific Leaders Forum to develop regional strategies in areas such as sustainable development, poverty alleviation and environmental management, and such strategies have been progressively published. Inevitably, there is considerable overlap between the risk management goals of such regional strategies when applied at the national level and the national disaster risk reduction/disaster management goals of the DMU programme. In a climate in which risk management was being seen increasingly as an integral part of good management practice over a wide range of national policies, strategies and programmes, the DMU programme was itself in danger of becoming a silo. HIGH-LEVEL ADVOCACY Many of these problems were identified in the course of a CHARM stakeholder workshop held in June 2001 in Tonga, and later that year, a planning workshop was held in Fiji to review the existing programme and its advocacy component. The original SOPAC 2000 study proposed the implementation of a three-year regional advocacy strategy to promote the benefits of risk management among politicians, policy-makers and non-traditional donor agencies. This workshop resulted in the establishment of the High-level Advocacy Working Group to assist in achieving this goal. The Fiji workshop suggested a number of Advocacy for Disaster Risk Management: Pacific Islands 133 specific activities that could be undertaken under a specific advocacy programme with the following goal and objective: • goal: the adoption by national governments of a comprehensive and integrated risk management policy designed to reduce vulnerability, enhance community resilience and achieve sustainable development; • objective: to obtain the highest level of national commitment to, and support for, the integration of disaster-reduction and response strategies into national development policies and plans. The workshop led to the appointment of the High Level Advocacy Team (HLAT) composed of three experts and to an outline programme of the team’s activities in the first half of 2002. Subsequent six-month meetings have reviewed the activities and methodologies of the HLAT and determined its future activities. Drawing on the experiences of early HLAT visits to Fiji and Samoa and of visits by individual HLAT members to a number of other Pacific Island countries, a November 2002 review formalized the working practice of the HLAT, as described below.",

    "abstract": "The Australian-Pacific Centre for Emergency and Disaster Information (APCEDI) began as an internal system of the Australian Foundation for the Peoples of Asia and the Pacific Ltd. (AFAP) and the Foundation of the Peoples of the South Pacific International (FSPI) (of which AFAP is a member) in the 1990s that was being used only locally. However, once its use caught on, it grew quickly. Various agencies such as national meteorological offices have been helpful in providing suggestions for improving APCEDI and ensuring that information provided by APCEDI supports official warning systems. It is also cost-effective, with most costs linked to communication and staffing costs during the cyclone season. The key objective of APCEDI, which is managed by the Australian Foundation for the Peoples of Asia and the Pacific Ltd. (AFAP), is to translate all the available meteorological and scientific data relating to a cyclonic event into simple yet accurate reports that can be easily understood by all stakeholders. APCEDI currently works with national disastermanagement offices and other key disaster stakeholders to devise community strategies and activities for vulnerable island communities in Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. When a cyclone forms and begins to threaten an area, the APCEDI system combines technical information with local knowledge of populations, demographics and topography. APCEDI then issues regular reports via the Internet and radio that provide communities and officials with easily understood information about an approaching cyclone. Reports are also posted on the APCEDI website, where they are freely available and members of the international community can view them at any time.  Subscribers to the website can also have APCEDI reports sent to them automatically by e-mail. APCEDI reports are now a key source for information on South Pacific cyclones and are used by local authorities throughout the region and by international donors that monitor cyclones from elsewhere. Many island communities, national disaster-management offices and local authorities use APCEDI to become better informed of the situation before, during Cyclone Tracking and Alert System: Pacific Islands 143 and after a cyclone hits. APCEDI reports are also widely used by major media outlets and other media organizations interested in cyclone news in the South Pacific. APCEDI reports are not official warnings, however. The reports are designed to work in tandem with official national and regional warning systems in order to provide more comprehensive contextual information about both the cyclone and the nature of the islands and communities likely to be affected. Once cyclones have passed, the APCEDI system also reports on the damage and the relief efforts that are being mobilized to assist the affected islands. APCEDI reports have been used by authorities not only to plan for approaching cyclones but also to find and rescue missing ships, locate missing persons, and coordinate and plan postcyclone operations. APCEDI is also used as an alert and information system during volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and non-cyclonic storms, after earthquakes and during other naturalhazard events such as droughts and floods. Before APCEDI was created, local communities, officials, resorts, tourists and many others living and working on various Pacific islands relied on hard-tointerpret meteorological data and reports often from distant locations in Australia, Fiji or New Zealand. These distant mete orological centres had almost no local knowledge of the islands being affected other than what they could see on their maps and charts. Often, official alerts were targeted to islands that had no population, and remote islands with populations were being overlooked or had no means of receiving warnings. In addition, early-warning information was often received too late, did not adequately cover all the threatened areas, was sent in a language that could not be understood by the recipients, and/or included scientific concepts that local officials had difficulty in interpreting. Compounding the problems, some incountry meteorological field offices were not equipped with working computers, faxes or telephones. This meant that cyclones would arrive with little warning and adequate preparations could not be undertaken in time. This led to more people being killed and injured and far more damage being caused, especially in remote island areas. Given these problems, it was clear that there was a need for a reporting and alert mechanism that would provide accurate, useful information about the arrival of the cyclone, including its direction and intensity, as well as information about the communities and islands that were about to be affected and the situation once the cyclone had passed. Reports and alerts had to be crafted to take into account the local situation on the ground so that information could be tailored to the specific context and provide people with the best information and advice possible. The AFAP-Foundation for the Peoples of the South Pacific International (FSPI) Non-governmental Organization (NGO) Network has been operating in the South Pacific region since 1965. It has headquarters and field offices on most major islands and in most island States, including Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. As such, it was well placed to develop a Pacific-wide system such as APCEDI.",

    "abstract": "Recent initiatives in the field of preparedness for earthquakes and other natural hazards undertaken by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) have targeted a wide range of vulnerable stakeholders in the Philippines. One of these activities has been the organization of site- and stakeholder-specific earthquake drills and workshops that incorporate town-watching exercises and local knowledge-driven hazard mapping. Earthquake drills targeting families living in multi-storey housing projects have also been designed and practised. As a result of these initiatives, scientists in the Philippines are increasingly becoming involved in public education, teaching the public about natural hazards and how to respond properly when they occur. Scientists have thus been challenged to translate technical ideas into layman’s language. As a result, a range of scripts and storyboards for the design of posters and other materials relating to disaster-preparedness measures has been prepared. The erection of monuments commemorating past earthquakes and tsunamis has also been suggested as a way of reminding communities of their vulnerability and hence their need for making adequate preparations. The Collective Strengthening of Community Awareness for Natural Disasters (CSCAND) project aims to increase community awareness of natural disasters.  CSCAND evolved from a previous project, Crustal Stress and Community Awareness Network (CSCAN), which involved placing sensors several metres below ground to detect possible changes in stress in the Earth’s crust related to earthquake occurrences. The project, which took place on the islands of Luzon, where Manila is situated, involved training local volunteers to take readings from the crustal stress instruments. The readings were then sent to PHIVOLCS for analysis. The volunteer community observers were also taught to observe possible changes in their environment and to try to correlate these with the stress readings that they were taking. The CSCAN project was introduced to PHIVOLCS by a group of Chinese scientists from the United Nations Global Programme for the Integration of Public Administration and the Science of Disasters.  Collaborating agencies included the Philippine Civil Service Commission, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Department of National Defense, the Office of Civil Defense (OCD), the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) and the local government units of the ten CSCAN sites. The initiative has remained a research project while, for the past couple of years, other projects have increasingly focused on raising community awareness in the project area. The current strategy is to provide the ten CSCAN communities with knowledge of the hazards that they face so that, Collective Strengthening of Community Awareness: Philippines 151 ultimately, they can incorporate it into their own disaster and development plans. To institutionalize CSCAN, CSCAND was adopted as a subcommittee of the preparedness committee of the NDCC in September 2003. A steering committee for CSCAND was then established, headed by the NDCC, while a technical working group committee is headed by PHIVOLCS. While continuing to enhance CSCAN liaison activities and promote community participation in all aspects of disaster preparedness, CSCAND activity now involves various other stakeholders. Since the emphasis of the new project has been refocused towards enhancing community awareness of natural hazards, various workshops on earthquake and volcanic hazards have been conducted by PHIVOLCS in partnership with the Association of Structural Engineers of the Philippines, the Center for Disaster Preparedness, the NDCC and local government units (LGUs), with funding support from UNDP through the Environment and Natural Resources Capacity and Operations Enhancement Programme. To sustain interest and as an incentive for CSCAN observers to continue as volunteers, the observers are always invited to attend these CSCAND workshops where they are asked to share their experiences. In 2005, in addition to the communityawareness workshops, another project was conducted under CSCAND: “Strengthening the Disaster Preparedness Capacities of the Municipalities of Real, Infanta and Nakar, Quezon Province, to Geologic and Meteorological Hazards”. This project was devised as a response to the devastating typhoons that hit the Philippines in late 2004. The resulting tragedy prompted the Government of the Philippines, through Her Excellency President Gloria MacapagalArroyo, to appeal to the United Nations Country Team, in partnership with the Government of the Philippines, to ask for assistance in terms of food aid, support for small enterprises and the development of a hazard-assessment and warning system. In response, UNDP and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs agreed to provide funding. The UNDP country office in Manila, which has been a long-time partner of PHIVOLCS in various scientific and community-based activities, has invited PHIVOLCS to be the lead agency in implementing the hazard-mapping and warning-system components of this initiative.",

Cousin Island is also covered by various forms of insurance, including thirdparty liability, staff disability or death, and damage to buildings, the hulls of boats and mooring buoys. In addition, staff members have received training in first aid in case of accidents as well as training in firefighting and safety at sea. A health and safety manual is readily accessible on the island and all staff members carry mobile telephones. A designated helicopter landing pad is available for emergency evacuations and special tools are on hand for helicopter-related accidents. Cousin Island has also established a small fund to deal with emergency situations. Among the lessons learned is that, on remote islands such as Cousin, it is wise to “disaster proof” protected areas by thinking ahead as such areas could be hit by disasters and become inaccessible for some time. Cousin Island is a granitic island in the Seychelles (fig. 1). It became one of the world’s first sea and island reserves when Birdlife International purchased it in 1968. First awarded the status of “nature reserve” in 1968, it was given further protection when it was designated a “special reserve” in 1974. The transformation of the island from an ecologically impoverished and heavily exploited coconut plantation to a fully restored island has taken place through a policy of habitat restoration since 1968 (fig. 2). Figure 1 Cousin Island, located off the west coast of Praslin Island in the northern part of the Seychelles archipelago. 0 km 50 Cousine Silhouette Praslin Aride 55  30’E 4  30’S Building Resilience: Seychelles 167 As a result, conservation on Cousin Island has enjoyed great success, with a 300-per cent increase in the population of Seychelles warblers, once on the brink of extinction (fig. 3); the successful introduction of the Seychelles magpie robin (fig. 4); significant augmentation of the population of the Seychelles fody, a small olive-brown bird related to the weaver birds; and a dramatic increase in the numbers of nesting hawksbill turtles. The island is now the most important breeding site for hawksbill turtles in the western Indian Ocean. About 250,000 individuals of seven species of seabird also breed on the island. In addition, published studies reveal that Cousin Island reefs are home to a higher biomass of fish compared to reefs in other marine protected areas around granitic islands. Cousin Island is free of cats, rats and mice, the former two being among the major causes of the demise of native fauna on other islands. Taking these factors into account, Cousin Island is recognized as a biodiversity hotspot in the region. Its conservation programmes have not only enhanced biodiversity on the island itself but, by translocating threatened birds to other suitable sites, they have also led to Cousin Island acting as a nursery for endangered species.

The island attracts international tourists who pay to view the unique wildlife.  Initially, although those responsible for managing the island had put in place very successful conservation programmes, health and safety aspects as well as emergency planning and preparedness were neglected. This missing link in management is of critical importance because both biodiversity and human lives, particularly those of foreign tourists and staff, need to be safeguarded from accidents and disasters.",

    "abstract": "Slope failures causing landslides are common in many parts of Sri Lanka, particularly along the major roads. Typically, conventional roller-compacted concrete or rubble-masonry structures have been used to mitigate such events but these methods have drawbacks, including the length of time taken to construct such structures. Therefore, alternative methods for stabilizing hazardous slopes need to be investigated. Among the alternative approaches are soil nailing, which involves the insertion of steel rods into an unstable slope to pin it in position, and soil bioengineering, which involves spraying a mixture of grass-seeds, other seeds and fertilizer onto a suitable matrix so that when the seeds germinate, the roots hold the underlying soil in place. Both methods can help to reduce construction times so that work can be completed before the onset of the annual rainy season. Soil-nailing and soil-bioengineering methods were introduced into Sri Lanka by Soil Tech Ltd., a private company. Initially, in the late 1990s, Government officials provided Soil Tech Ltd. with a length of road on which to demonstrate the methods. During this period, the technical team developed the technology by introducing innovative items using locally available or imported materials. Local vendors have now been educated about the specifications of the materials required. Following the success of this demonstration project, the Road Development Authority (RDA) agreed to the current two-year project in which 3,300 square metres of cut roadside slopes would be soil nailed along the GampolaNawalapitiya and Gampola-Nuwara Eliya roads. For the new project, a technical team was formed that comprised representatives from Soil Tech Ltd., the University of Peradeniya Department of Geology and the project director from RDA. The team was responsible for educating the vendors and supervising activities. Small- to large-scale slope failures caused by gravity acting upon a destabilized layer of loose rock that rests on the bedrock occur frequently in Sri Lanka (fig. 1). In many instances, such landslides have been induced by heavy rainfall. However, man-made activities have also caused slope destabilization in many parts of the country. For example, in the central highlands, roads often experience such failures and urban construction in the region may also damage slopes. Typically, once destabilized, remedial measures include scraping away and disposing of any loose material without any significant engineering measure being taken to prevent further failures. In addition, in the recent past, large-scale tectonic plate movements, micro- to macroseismic activity, certain land-use activities Stabilizing Slopes: Sri Lanka 179 and infrastructure developments have caused the destabilization of slopes in many parts of Sri Lanka. Particularly in the case of infrastructure development, there is a need for proper cost-effective and user-friendly measures to curb slope destabilization. Proposed highways in the central highlands and southern regions of the country will require additional attention since there are plans to operate them as toll roads. Many small hydrological projects initiated in the central highlands, including the construction of reservoirs, may also require containment of the slopes and embankments to cope with the potential destabilization of the sites. Since the slopes in hilly areas are moderate to high, with angles ranging from 10 to 60 degrees, small- to largescale slope destabilization is common around many cities in the central highlands. In such areas, there is a high risk of local slope failure, especially during heavy rain. These failures may eventually propagate downhill, endangering property and installations along the whole length of the slope. Once a surface failure develops or a major slope failure is initiat ed, remedial measures are very expensive. It is therefore of great importance to provide efficient and effective measures to identify and to support compromised slopes before any adverse slope failure occurs. Conventionally, roller-compacted concrete or rubble-masonry structures have been used to stabilize slopes. These methods require a large area at the base of the slope and a long construction time, both of which create inconveniences. They are also time-consuming to construct and expensive as they require a large amount of building materials. Depending on the slope and the pressure of the water in the soil pores, these structures last from 20 to 30 years, after which time, cracks start to appear. At this vulnerable stage, owners are unable to choose inexpensive replacement or remedial actions. The invention of soil-nailing and soil-bioengineering methods, which are slowly being accepted by the public in Sri Lanka as viable alternatives to conventional slope-stabilization methods, now allows more effective and less costly remedial measures to be installed on compromised slopes.

    "abstract": "Of all the waterborne diseases, cholera is perhaps the best known and most serious. Cholera outbreaks continue to be recorded in many countries in Africa and Asia and, after being absent for almost a century, the disease has also re-emerged in South America. Although the proliferation of municipally treated water supplies has curbed many waterborne diseases, epidemics continue to occur because of heavy contamination of water sources, poor treatment of drinking water or failing infrastructure. Re-evaluation of water disinfection protocols, including those employing chlorine, is necessary, especially when municipal water purification systems are less effective, specifically during environmental disasters such as monsoon rains and floods. Under these conditions, intervention methods must be inexpensive, culturally acceptable and readily accessible to the public in developing countries. Together with education, increased public awareness and, most importantly, widespread initiatives to protect water from undesired contamination, such methods can also be used on a daily basis to protect communities against waterborne diseases. Research and field trials carried out at the University of Maryland, United States, and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), have shown that simple filtration through four to eight layers of sari cloth can reduce cholera contamination in water. More than a billion people, mainly in Africa, Asia and Latin America, live without access to safe drinking water. In Bangladesh, tube wells, which tap into groundwater, are considered to provide safe water for drinking. However, studies suggest that they fail to protect against gastrointestinal diseases. In addition, it has been reported that as many as half of the wells drilled in the late 1960s – a project aimed at resolving Bangladesh’s severe surface water pollution problem – have been found to be contaminated with arsenic in amounts exceeding 50 parts per billion, with concentrations up to 10 ❖ Costs: The cost of the field trial was US$786,000, funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health, United States. The cost of the laboratory-based studies to develop the filtration method was US$95,000, which was funded by the Thrasher Research Fund, United States. Filtering out Cholera: Bangladesh 21 times higher in some heavily contaminated areas. To avoid chemical poisoning, local governments have advised villagers to abandon arsenic-contaminated shallow tube wells and to look for alternative sources of water. This advice has compelled many people to switch to untreated surface water. As a result, a large part of the rural population now depends on untreated surface water for household consumption. Indeed, water taken from ponds and rivers is preferred for reasons of taste, convenience or a local belief that “quality” water is “natural”, that is, not chemically treated. Using such untreated water poses a real threat to public health. Unlike smallpox, which has been successfully eradicated through a global vaccination campaign, many waterborne diseases cannot be eradicated because the causal organisms occur naturally in aquatic environments. Most notable among these is Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium that causes cholera. According to one estimate, some 5.5 million cases of cholera are diagnosed each year. In a 1998 report, the World Health Organization (WHO) gives the more conservative figure of 293,000 reported cases of cholera worldwide. In 2001, 58 countries officially notified WHO of some 184,000 cases of cholera and more than 2,700 deaths. Indeed, the situation has worsened recently with the re-introduction of cholera into South America. Until 1992, both North and South America had been free of cholera epidemics for almost a century. Unfortunately, after a massive epidemic that began in Lima, Peru, and subsequently involved most Latin American countries, cholera has become endemic in the region once again, killing more than 8,000 people since 1992. Human volunteer trials have shown that, if ingested, 10,000 to one million Vibrio cholerae bacteria, or vibrios, are likely to produce clinical cholera. In addition, a study of families and neighbourhoods has demonstrated that people who used V. cholerae-free water for drinking but used V. cholerae-infected water for cooking, bathing or washing had the same rate of infection as those who used V. cholerae-infected water for drinking, suggesting the importance of using safe water for all household purposes. Once there is a case reported in a family, there is also a 30 per cent chance of other family members becoming infected. Once the first, or index, case is reported, therefore, it is likely that further spread within the family will occur, probably via food or other means such as direct contact, which may not be prevented even if the water brought into the house is free of V. cholerae. It is important, therefore, to prevent infection at the level of the index case. Studies carried out at the University of Maryland over the past 30 years have confirmed an association between Vibrio cholerae and zooplankton, microscopic crustaceans that live in water (fig. 1). In cholera-endemic areas such as Bangladesh, the occurrence of cholera vibrios increases as populations of zooplankton increase, especially during the summer months. Flooding, a common phenomenon in Bangladesh during the summer monsoon season, also causes an increase in phytoplankton populations, which is followed by an increase in zooplankton numbers. Such zooplankton blooms provide a suitable niche for the multiplication of the number of vibrios present in the environment. Indeed, research has shown that a single copepod can harbour up to 10,000 vibrios, so ingesting just one or two copepods could cause clinical cholera. To compound the problems caused by floods, even the barest necessities are difficult to obtain and purifying water by boiling it or by treatment with chlorine or other chemicals becomes almost impossible. Sanitary latrines, for example, which would prevent the release of large numbers of vibrios into the environment, are not available in times of flooding. Figure 1. Scanning electron micrograph of a copepod, a microscopic crustacean that lives in water and can carry Vibrio cholerae bacteria. However, even under such difficult conditions, it is still possible to filter water through cloth. Filtering water through a nylon net at the time of collection has been shown to be effective in removing the tiny crustacean cyclops, a species of water flea and an intermediate host of the guinea worm that causes dracunculiasis. Removing cyclops in this way is now widely recommended as a useful method of preventing dracunculiasis, which was once a common disease in Africa. Although boiling water prior to drinking will kill cyclops and guinea worm larvae as well other pathogenic microorganisms, including V. cholerae, it is a time-consuming, expensive procedure. Moreover, in countries such as Bangladesh, boiling water is not regularly practised as fuelwood is in short supply. To overcome these problems, a simple method based on water collected through four to eight layers of sari cloth was tested in Matlab, Bangladesh, and found to be effective in reducing the number of cases of cholera in the study population by removing V. cholerae cells attached to the plankton and particulate matter. This simple filtration method has the potential to reduce cholera infections if disseminated and used throughout the country.",

    "abstract": "Small water reservoirs (SWRs), used to collect and store rainwater for family use, have been used for thousands of years in arid parts of western China. More recently, SWR technology has been systematically developed and tested by scientists at the Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute (CAREERI). The dissemination of knowledge concerning the construction of SWRs using modern materials and designs is now a programme officially approved by the Government of China. Extension workers interact directly with local farmers, training them in how to build and use SWRs in a project that combines the mitigation of water scarcity with the development of the family economy. It is estimated that, within the next five to ten years, China will record a shortfall in water requirements of some 20 billion cubic metres. Even now, the per capita availability of water in China is among the lowest in world, with supplies providing only one quarter of the recommended daily amount. The problem is most acute in poor, rural areas where some 80 million people suffer from a shortage of safe drinking water. Seventy per cent of China’s poor live in the west of the country, an arid zone that covers 35 per cent of the nation’s area but receives less than 300 millimetres of rainfall each year. The systematic collection and use of rainwater began in China some 4,000 years ago and the use of “water cellar”type SWRs to store rainwater was recorded 600 years ago. These simple structures are suitable for various climates and landscapes and are easy to manage, even for small families. Beginning in 1988, scientists at CAREERI began research into improving traditional SWR designs. In 1995, the most severe drought for 60 years occurred in Gansu, where CAREERI is located, affecting some three million people and two million livestock. In response, the Government of China expanded its SWR project. Since then, more than two million SWRs covering a total catchment area of 160 million square metres and with a ❖ Costs: CAREERI has invested some US$150,000 in the theory, technology, design and effective use of small water reservoirs (SWRs) over the past ten years. The cost of constructing an SWR with a 40-cubic metre capacity is less than US$200.The drinking water and irrigation requirement for a family of four or five people farming an irrigated area of 0.15 to 0.2 hectares costs between US$450 and US$550. Family-sized reservoirs: China 31 capacity of 80 million cubic metres have been constructed. These SWRs provide safe drinking water for millions of people as well as irrigation water for 250,000 hectares of crops. However, as most people suffering from water scarcity live in poor rural areas, they cannot afford to build SWRs. Therefore, it has been necessary for governments, both local and national, to support their construction by enacting enabling policies and for humanitarian aid societies to provide finance. For their part, scientists and technologists are focusing on decreasing construction costs and developing more efficient ways of using and saving water.",

    "abstract": "The Thar or Indian Desert is centred in the northwest Indian state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan. The region is characterized by a hot climate with low and erratic rainfall and recurring droughts. Not surprisingly, more than 60 per cent of Rajasthan is classed as arid and access to safe drinking water is a prime concern. Available groundwater often contains high concentrations of such salts as sodium chloride (common salt), fluorides and nitrates, rendering it unsafe for drinking. The indigenous people, therefore, depend largely on unreliable rains to supply their drinking water requirements. Over the years, traditional systems such as bawari, jhalra, khadin, nadi and tanka have been developed to collect, store and use rainwater for the benefit of people, animals and crops. Surveys carried out in Rajasthan reveal that 43 per cent of the rural drinking water supply is sourced from nadi, 35 per cent from tanka, 15 per cent from wells and tube wells and 8 per cent from other sources. Scientists from the Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRl), Jodhpur, have taken some of these traditional structures, improved their design and disseminated the new designs to village communities throughout the region. In other areas, depleted freshwater aquifers have led to an acute shortage of drinking water. Artificial recharge structures composed of ponds linked to infiltration wells (where the rocks are hard), percolation tanks (in alluvial formations) and sub-surface barriers across ephemeral streams (in sandy beds) have been designed and constructed in six villages. Following the construction of these aquifer-recharging structures, the availability of safe drinking water in these villages improved dramatically. One immediate impact is that the requirement to fetch drinking water from sources far from the village, often under the scorching sun and over difficult sandy terrain (a job usually carried out by women), has been removed, resulting in perceptible health improvements. Rainfall is the main source of potable water on Earth. In a country the size of India, however, the amount of rain that falls varies widely. Cherrapunji in Meghalaya, northeast India, for example, receives 10,000 millimetres of rain a year compared to just 100 millimetres for Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. Safe drinking water has always been a major concern in the arid zones of India, which cover some 12 per cent of the country. The 75,000-square kilometre Thar Desert, which covers 62 per cent of the State of Rajasthan, is characterized by low, erratic rainfall, varying from more than 400 millimetres a year in the east to less than 100 millimetres in the extreme west of the region. In addition, the erratic distribution of rainfall between seasons often leads to protracted droughts. Recently, for example, western Rajasthan Improving traditional techniques: India 39 experienced two periods of drought, each lasting four years (1984-1987 and 19992002), while droughts lasting two years are a frequent phenomenon in the region. Highly permeable soils and warm temperatures, linked to the fact that large parts of the area also lack a drainage network that could supply surface water, add to the area’s water shortage problems. The region’s drinking water situation is further complicated by the groundwater, which is often deep-lying and typically of poor quality. An increasing reliance on groundwater for irrigation and other uses, however, means that the resource is being over-exploited. Against a net annual availability of 3,400 million cubic metres of water, the amount extracted is more than 4,200 million cubic metres, a negative balance of more than 750 million cubic metres a year. The actual rate of exploitation ranges from 59 to 195 per cent, depending on the area. The marginal quality of groundwater is also causing the degradation of agricultural land and affecting the health of both humans and animals in some areas. In addition, scant rainfall and recurring droughts mean that aquifers are not being recharged, making groundwater resources temporally and spatially highly vulnerable. Despite these problems, the demand for water in the region is increasing steadily and is projected to continue rising as human and livestock populations expand and new industries are created (table 1). Given such conditions, local people depend largely on rainwater to supply their drinking water requirements and, over the centuries, have developed several indigenous techniques for harvesting, conserving and protecting this “free” resource from contamination. Even so, these systems have their limitations or have fallen out of use. There is a need, therefore, to Table 1. Estimated water demand for the arid areas of Rajasthan (values given in millions of cubic metres). 1981 1991 2001 2011 Human consumption 197 236 289 359 (at 40 LPD1) Livestock consumption 249 290 332 415 (at 30 LPD) Irrigation 5,178 5,696 6,265 6,892 (at 30 cm ha-1) Industry 16 17 18 22 1 LPD = litres per capita per day. develop new technologies, using the existing traditions of rainwater management as a starting point but adding innovative and appropriate improvements. To this end, in 1987, the Government of India launched its Technology Mission on Drinking Water, which has since been renamed the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission. It was recognized that the dunes and shifting sands of the Thar Desert made it unfeasible to develop an organized water infrastructure that would meet the demands of the area’s scattered settlements. Under the Mission, therefore, the Central Arid Zone Research Institute (CAZRI), Jodhpur, was given the responsibility for identifying, improving and popularizing rainwater harvesting systems for the supply of safe drinking water in rural areas on a sustainable basis. Based on scientific research, CAZRI has perfected the structural design of several rainwater harvesting systems. Modern methods of rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge such as the use of percolation tanks, sub-surface barriers and ponds with infiltration wells have also been developed to aid the rejuvenation of depleted freshwater aquifers.",

    "abstract": "The traditional practice of collecting rainwater where it falls has been revived to provide inexpensive drinking water for thousands of people. Rainwater harvesting has been carried out for generations in many areas around the world, including Colombia in South America, the Atlas Mountains in north Africa, the Himalayas and the deserts of Rajasthan in Asia and the remote Pacific island of Fiji. Rural communities have the traditional skills and technical competence to collect rainwater. As they often cannot wait for government action, a practical solution is to come together to contribute labour and materials to construct their own rainwater harvesting structures. In the process, they collectively decide how much they are prepared to pay for the water that will be under their own ownership and management. The innovative aspect of the Barefoot College rooftop rainwater harvesting programme is the application of a centuries-old technology to benefit whole communities in schools, dispensaries and other public places so that everyone, including men, women and children from both rich and poor families and different castes, have access to drinking water from a single source. During the 20 years during which this project has been implemented, more than 550 rooftop rainwater collection systems have been constructed and it has been repeatedly demonstrated that, especially in drought-prone areas or where the groundwater is saline, rooftop rainwater harvesting is the only sustainable alternative for ensuring continued access to safe drinking water. To provide drinking water for village communities, the primary choice for water planners and engineers in much of India is to install hand pumps for the ❖ Costs: Communities contribute cash, if possible, or voluntary labour, usually two days a month. Together, these inputs account for about 10 per cent of the cost of building a rooftop rainwater harvesting system. To date, inputs of this kind are estimated to be valued at more than US$100,000. Other contributions have been received from German Agro Action (50 per cent); Plan International (35 per cent); the Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India (10 per cent); the Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Technology Mission, Government of India (2 per cent); the Georg Fischer Foundation, Switzerland (3 per cent); and the Smita Suchde Foundation (2 per cent). Together, these contributions amount to almost US$1 million. Rooftop rain harvesting: India 53 exploitation of groundwater. Where this is not possible, the second preference is for piped water supply schemes sometimes from a source hundreds of miles away. Many companies provide the technical support to implement such projects, including gathering and interpreting information from satellites, manufacturing pipes, pumps and desalination plants and providing other accessories. This is an expensive process. As far as engineers are concerned, the provision of drinking water has always been considered a technical problem. To poor rural communities, however, the provision of and access to safe drinking water constitute a social problem. No longer can remote rural schools wait for government engineers to provide them with drinking water. The provision of hand pumps and piped water supply systems have failed to work and alternatives need to be found. Rooftop rainwater harvesting is a viable alternative. Rooftop rainwater harvesting is a traditional practice that dates back hundreds of years, is relatively inexpensive to implement and is usually ignored by engineers. The technique is particularly relevant in arid areas, mountainous areas where rainwater would otherwise flow rapidly away, or areas where the groundwater is saline. Indeed, owing to the unsustainable extraction of groundwater, mainly for irrigating crops, many areas of India are suffering from increased groundwater salinity. Problems with the increasing salinity of groundwater can also be mitigated by harvesting rainwater. In this case, run-off water from large areas of land can be collected and channelled into deep, specially constructed wells so that the rainwater flows directly into the aquifer. In this way, millions of litres of rainwater can quickly percolate into the ground instead of being allowed to evaporate and be wasted. Alternatively, ponds can be created that allow the collected rainwater to seep slowly through the rock layers to the aquifer. WH Y R A I N WAT E R H A RV E S T I N G? Rainwater should be harvested because: • water should never be wasted and allowed to flow out of any village or community facing a shortage of drinking water; • it costs less to collect rainwater than to exploit groundwater; • collecting rainwater is the only way of recharging the water sources and revitalizing dry wells and hand pumps; • it provides an opportunity for communities to work together and manage their own water resources as well as productive employment for the rural poor in their own villages; and • traditional knowledge, skills and materials can be used to collect water and no technical assistance is required from the government for the repair and maintenance of the system.",

In such areas, the Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI) has installed a number of water purification plants designed by Institute staff and incorporating a thin film composite (TFC) reverse osmosis (RO) membrane developed by Institute scientists. Important lessons learned during the installation of such units were: • obtaining a reliable electricity supply is always problematical; • villagers do not like the idea of chemicals being added to water, even though such chemicals are removed before the water is safe for drinking; • precise compliance with international water quality standards is less of an issue than providing water of reasonable quality in adequate quantities and at a cost that government agencies entrusted with the job of supplying water can afford; • water treatment units should be of a size appropriate for catering only to villages in their immediate proximity; otherwise, transporting the water becomes a problem; • water treatment units must be robust and easy to operate so that local personnel can be trained in their operation; • there is an ongoing need for appropriate solutions in the aftermath of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and tsunamis when the provision of drinking water becomes an urgent issue. Recognizing these issues, CSMCRI has: • improved the flux of its RO membrane without compromising its salt rejection efficiency; • developed simple RO systems that avoid the use of chemicals; ❖ Costs: Two-stage seawater reverse osmosis phase: US$300,000, including US$100,000 for capital costs (salaries and infrastructure) at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), allocated to the Department of Science and Technology (DST), New Delhi, and US$70,000 allocated to the District Collectorate Ramanathpuram, Tamil Nadu State, to cover civil work and 25 per cent of equipment costs. Animal-powered reverse osmosis phase: US$30,000, including US$22,000 for salaries, infrastructure and a rural action programme at CSIR, New Delhi, and US$8,000 supplied by M/s Pepsico India Holdings Ltd., Gurgaon, allocated for capital costs. Reverse osmosis: India 63 • used its high-flux membrane modules to develop a two-stage RO desalination unit capable of producing 500 to 1,000 litres of safe drinking water per hour at low pressure (600 pounds per square inch, psi) (and therefore at a lower cost and with improved safety) from seawater or highly brackish groundwater desalination; and • developed a speed increaser, or accelerator, that allows the RO unit to be interfaced with power supplied by oxen to convert brackish water into potable water at a rate of 500 to 800 litres per hour. CSMCRI has successfully demonstrated the effective functioning of prototype RO units in villages. The Institute is now further fine-tuning the technology and attempting to reduce costs while implementing the large-scale use of RO systems that go beyond demonstration projects. Osmosis is the process by which water passes through a semipermeable membrane from a dilute solution to a more concentrated solution without any input of energy. Reverse osmosis (RO), however, involves high pressures to force pure (or nearly pure) water through a semipermeable membrane, leaving behind any dissolved chemicals in the original solution. Among the problems associated with the widespread uptake of the reverse osmosis of brackish water is the fact that it is unsuitable if the water to be desalinated contains too much salt. This means that seawater cannot be used as a source of drinking water. In addition, electricity is needed to provide the power to drive RO systems, but areas that lack safe drinking water often also lack a reliable source of electrical power. Some small systems designed to treat water that is not too brackish can be run using solar or wind power, but both sources of energy are costly and weather-dependent. In contrast, animal power is often readily available in many rural areas. Even so, until now, animals had not been used to drive an RO desalination plant. The State of Tamil Nadu in southeast India, particularly the district of Ramanathpuram, faces an acute shortage of drinking water. Since it is a coastal area, however, seawater and highly brackish underground water are plentiful. Large seawater RO desalination plants have been installed in the district but replacement membrane modules are expensive and maintenance costs are high. Large, centrally managed plants also add to the cost of transporting water to end-users. Smaller plants located in individual villages or catering to a cluster of villages are an attractive option but suitable low-capacity seawater desalination plants are too expensive. CSMCRI scientists are responding to these challenges, aiming to develop and adapt indigenous technologies for water desalination that will suit both the requirements of government water supply agencies and the needs of rural communities. To desalinate seawater, semipermeable membranes must have a 99-per cent salt rejection capability and are typically operated at pressures greater than 800 psi. This is technologically difficult, so CSMCRI scientists developed an alternative, novel method based on a two-stage desalination process using a high-flux thin film composite (TFC) RO membrane developed in-house for use with brackish water. The advantages of this method included: • the possibility of desalinating seawater at a pressure of 600 psi, allowing the use of less expensive hardware and thereby reducing capital costs; and • the high flux of the brackish water membranes meant that operating costs became comparable with those of sophisticated seawater desalination units. CSMCRI proposed the use of its twostage seawater desalination technology to local officials in Ramanathpuram district and offered to install two prototype units capable of desalinating 2,000 litres of water per day. It was agreed that the two units should be installed in villages that were the most hard-pressed. In addition, the Ramanathpuram Administrator (Collector) offered to build the necessary infrastructure and contribute US$10,000 for the units besides civil costs, the balance of the costs being secured by CSMCRI. Realizing that once a unit began operating, its value would be recognized, CSMCRI decided to procure the balance of the funds from its internal resources before approaching entities such as the Department of Science and Technology for further funds. The justification for developing an animal-powered RO unit was that the electricity supply in villages, especially the three-phase power required for medium- to large-capacity RO desalination units, was usually lacking. In contrast, during the summer months when the requirement for drinking water is especially acute, draught animals, common in many villages, had less work. In addition, following natural disasters such as the supercyclone that hit Orissa in October 1999, the earthquake that hit Kutch in January 2001 and the Asian tsunami of December 2004, a lack of electrical power means that alternative energy sources must be used to relieve the immediate crisis concerning the availability of safe drinking water. In all these cases, animal power could have been put to use. In more day-to-day situations, there are many isolated communities that are not connected to the national power grid. In addition, there are cases where generators are not acceptable and “silent” power is required, for example in the Sundarbans Tiger Reserve in West Bengal. CSMCRI, therefore, developed a speed increaser that allows its high-flux RO unit to be interfaced with power supplied by oxen.

    "abstract": "Lare is a dry area with no permanent rivers. It receives an average of 700 millimetres of rainfall a year but this varies widely from one year to another. It is also unevenly distributed among the seasons. Farmers in Lare have identified four major constraints to agricultural production, with scarcity of water as the major one. Before 1998, about 70 per cent of all households in the area experienced shortages of water. In addition, not only was there insufficient water, but it was also of poor quality and caused a high incidence of water-borne diseases. In 1999, a project involving nine collaborating institutions was initiated to address rainwater harvesting practices and water treatment along with other technologies required by the farmers. The project resulted in a dramatic increase in the adoption rate of run-off water harvesting technology from 409 water pans in 1998 to 2,400 water pans in 2002. There was also a marked increase in the adoption of simple water treatments carried out in the home. The incidence of water-borne diseases has been reduced and, related to the increased health status of the local communities, there has been an increase in human productivity. The availability of safe water for crops and for home consumption has improved agricultural productivity in Lare and helped to reduce poverty levels. It was also noted that, to avoid environmental degradation, especially in terms of soil erosion, the use of correctly designed rainwater run-off harvesting methods is important and has actually improved reforestation in the area. In Kenya, the practice of harvesting runoff water is carried out mainly in the more arid and semi-arid regions. The most common methods are the collection of rainwater falling on rooftops and the collection of floodwater from watercourses for domestic use. Typically, the harvested water is stored in tanks or dugout water pans (which are ponds used for storing water that runs off fields and roads) or used directly for crop production. However, the adoption rate was found to be poor because there was a lack of understanding of the technology by many farmers and poor information transfer to the farmers by agricultural extension officers. As in many other developing countries, the provision of water to all Kenyans is hampered by financial constraints. However, the nation’s water requirements are increasing and even people living in areas that are not necessarily semi-arid also find themselves in need of simple technologies to harvest rainwater in order to achieve some level of self-sufficiency in water. In addition, an increasing number of people are also settling in marginal areas where infrastructural support from the central government is often lacking. This was the situation that faced the people in Lare. Rainwater harvesting: Kenya 77 Lare Division, which is located in Nakuru District to the west of Lake Nakuru National Park, covers an area of about 134 square kilometres. It consists of four locations: Bagaria, Gichobo, Lare and Pwani/Naishi Game. The average rainfall in the region is about 700 millimetres a year, but this is very erratic and unevenly distributed and there is a serious drought every three to five years. This situation calls for technologies to improve water storage for use during periods of drought, especially as the area does not have a piped water supply but relies instead on seasonal rivers, dams to collect run-off water and a few boreholes. In 1996, Lare Division had a population of about 30,000, including some 6,000 farming families usually living on privately owned land, with the average farm size of about one hectare. A recent survey estimated that some 70 per cent of these households were experiencing water supply problems, with the only sources being a borehole (a second borehole was not operational) and ten heavily silted dams. Women, in particular, were suffering as they often had to carry water over long distances (up to 13 kilometres). The issue of improving water harvesting in the area was highlighted by farmers in several stakeholder meetings in Lare as an urgent problem that needed to be addressed. The objective of this project, therefore, was to train farmers in Lare Division in water harvesting techniques so that they would be empowered to tackle their own water shortage problems. Figure 1. A farmer research extension group (FREG) meeting in Lare.",

    "abstract": "Drinking water in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula is obtained from a thin lens of fresh groundwater that floats above denser, saline water. Currently, the disposal of waste water is carried out by injecting usually untreated but sometimes treated water tens of metres below the fresh/salt water interface in this aquifer. Thus, the only source of drinking water on the peninsula is also the recipient of both municipal and industrial waste. Scientists from the Instituto de Geofísica of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) have been carrying out a hydrogeological characterization of the aquifer. Municipal, State and federal government officials are now beginning to recognize the importance of this work. To date, the available hydrogeological, geochemical and geophysical data for northwest Yucatan have been analysed and it has been proposed that a hydrogeological reserve zone be established for Merida, the largest city on the peninsula. The Yucatan Peninsula (fig. 1) is made of limestones and evaporates, a type of sedimentary rock formed by the evaporation of seawater. As a result of the dissolution of the calcium carbonate in the limestone, a mature karstic system of caves and potholes exists throughout the peninsula. To date, more than 500 kilometres of subaquatic cave systems have been mapped in the area, and the mapping efforts continue to this day (fig. 2). For example, more than 130 kilometres of underground passageways in the Ox Bel-Ha system, located in southeastern Yucatan, have been mapped, making it the largest subaquatic cave system in the world. Here it is possible for a diver to enter a cenote or sinkhole nine kilometres from the coast and emerge at sea without ever seeing daylight. ❖ Costs: Total cost to date is US$460,000, including US$70,000 provided by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACyT), the federal agency that funds scientific research in Mexico, used to buy geophysical and computer equipment and to carry out field research; US$260,000 provided by the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), used to cover student fellowships, to purchase hydrogeological field equipment and for travel to field sites; US$30,000 from Grupo Xcaret (private sector) used to develop a monitoring system for the Yucatan aquifer; and an estimated US$100,000 from the Quintana Roo Speleological Survey to cover the costs of exploration. Improving groundwater management: Mexico 89 Figure 1. Location of the Yucatan Peninsula, the area covered by this case study. Figure 2. Cenote Maya Blue, a subterranean cave system mapped by the Quintana Roo Speleological Survey. However, owing to the nature of these rocks, very little soil has formed. The lack of soil cover means that the aquifer within the karst is a thin, freshwater lens that floats on top of saline water. Beneath Merida, the largest city on the peninsula with a population of some 600,000, the freshwater lens is just 60 metres thick. The porous nature of the limestone rock also means that saltwater has been found more than 110 kilometres from the coast. This means that the aquifer is both the source of the region’s drinking water as well as the recipient of its domestic and industrial liquid waste. Also, as a result of these large conduits, any contaminants that reach the water table can quickly be transported elsewhere, eventually reaching the sea. Contamination of this fragile groundwater system with metals, organic and inorganic compounds and biological materials has been documented in different areas of northwest Yucatan. Related to this, a major threat to the health of the inhabitants of northwest Yucatan, in particular those living in Merida and between Merida and the coast (or “downgradient” from Merida), is the lack of a municipal sewage collection and treatment system. Pathogens transported by groundwater continue to be the leading cause of death for children under five years old. Another issue of concern is that reports published or made available by the National Water Commission, the federal agency in charge of water, do not receive any external review and very often no internal review either. However, these reports are still taken to be the “official reports” on which many regulations are based. Critics in academia have suggested to the National Water Commission that the information be ranked as it is commonly done in academia: the primary source is international peer-reviewed literature, followed by Mexican peer-reviewed literature, and finally non-peer-reviewed literature such as theses, environmental impact statements and technical reports. Another threat to the eastern part of the Yucatan Peninsula is the rapid growth of the tourist industry. Although the Government is trying to regulate its expansion, the reality is that little planning is taking place. Currently, there are approximately 80,000 hotel rooms on the Riviera Maya. Estimates suggest that between 10 and 18 support personnel are needed per hotel room, taking into account the hotel support staff as well as the indirect support staff (local mechanics, staff at the supermarket, etc.). However, no estimates of the carrying capacity of the area in terms of the number of hotel rooms that the area can accommodate in a sustainable fashion have been made. Thus, although the area is developing fast, basic information with regards to groundwater and other environmental issues is missing. The thickness of the freshwater lens beneath the area is unknown as is the nature of the fresh/salt-water interface, the direction and velocity of groundwater flow and the spatial distribution of groundwater quality. While the hotels and tourist resorts have installed modern water purification and water treatment facilities, the settlements that have grown up in support of these facilities lack such basic necessities as piped potable water or sewage collection and treatment systems. As a result, local inhabitants often drill a shallow well (in this area, the water table is less than six metres deep) and dispose of their domestic waste by either dumping it into available cenotes or excavating a shallow borehole into which the waste is pumped. Thus, there is reason to suspect that groundwater, especially in the larger cities, is carrying a significant bacteriological burden (fig. 3). The collection and disposal of solid waste constitute another issue affecting water quality. Currently, abandoned quarries are used as “sanitary landfills”. Again, this practice is not a healthy one. Figure 3. Schematic diagram showing freshwater flowing out to sea, saltwater flowing inland, and deep (approximately 50 metres below the land surface) disposal of untreated sewage. The presence of vertical conduits could allow treated water to migrate upwards into the freshwater lens (after Meacham, 2000). Improving groundwater management: Mexico 91 What is needed is a master plan for the Yucatan Peninsula that considers at least three issues required to achieve the sustainable development of the area: • provision of safe drinking water to the inhabitants; • development of a waste collection and treatment system; and • development of a solid waste collection and disposal programme. Achieving these goals will require scientific studies to estimate the true extent of the groundwater resources of the peninsula and the development of a map of the extensive subaquatic cave systems, as these are preferred flow paths for any contaminants.",

    "abstract": "Envenomations due to snakebites constitute a significant public health problem in tropical and subtropical countries. A dramatic consequence of snakebites is local muscle destruction (myonecrosis) caused by a group of toxins that affect skeletal muscle cells (myotoxins). This project investigated the neutralizing properties of fucoidan, a negatively charged polysaccharide extracted from the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus, towards myotoxins isolated from different snake venoms. This compound was selected on the basis of recent advances in the knowledge of the molecular structure of the toxins and their mode of action. Results showed that fucoidan forms complexes with the myotoxins and inactivates their muscledamaging activity. Preclinical assessment of the neutralizing ability of fucoidan in experimentally envenomed mice demonstrated that the rapid local administration of fucoidan can prevent up to 50 per cent of the muscle damage typically induced by snake venom. These investigations highlight the potential of an inexpensive natural product, fucoidan, or possible derivatives of it, as a complementary treatment to serotherapy against the muscle-damaging activity of snake venoms. Each year, more than 50,000 people are killed by bites from poisonous snakes, mostly in tropical and subtropical coun tries. Many more people survive being bitten but suffer serious and often permanent injuries as a result of the bite. Envenomations due to snakebites, therefore, are an important public health problem and have a significant socioeconomic impact. Among the most dramatic consequences of snakebites is local damage to muscle tissue, or myonecrosis. In envenomations by crotaline snakes (which include rattlesnakes and other pit vipers), this effect is mediated mainly by myotoxins, a group of toxins that attack skeletal muscle cells. Typically, poisonous snakebites are treated by administering antibody preparations (known as antivenoms) that bind to the various venom toxins and block their deleterious activities. These antivenoms are usually obtained from the sera of immunized animals such as horses and sheep. Often, however, antivenoms do not contain sufficiently high levels of neutralizing antibodies to be effective against the myotoxins. In addition, antibodies are large molecules that diffuse slowly into the patients’ tissues, which contrasts with the rapid action and spread of the toxins. The effectiveness of conventional serotherapy with antivenoms, therefore, has important limitations. This problem has motivated the search for alternative neutralizing molecules that could complement and enhance the conventional antivenom treatment. The long-term goal of such studies is to provide new pharmaceutical tools to prevent, as much as possible, the development of irreversible lesions in patients bitten by poisonous snakes that may leave them with permanent tissue loss and, in severe cases, disability (fig. 1).",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 40 per cent of the world population is exposed to the risk of malaria, and more than 3.5 million people die of the disease each year. Resistance of the malaria parasites to chemotherapeutic agents such as chloroquine has increased in recent years and there is an urgent need for new therapeutic agents to be developed. Artemisinin, a once-promising antimalarial agent derived from the Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia annua, is associated with several drawbacks and is no longer used clinically. However, ether derivatives of dihydro-artemisinin such as arteether and artemether are much better drugs than artemisinin. Of these, arteether is preferred because artemether has been associated with some neurotoxic effects. The synthesis of arteether from artemisinin results in a mixture of the corresponding α and ß isomers, of which the crystalline ß-isomer is the actual active drug. As these isomers are difficult to separate, WHO recommends a 40:60 mixture of α and ß isomers for clinical use. However, RRL-Jorhat has developed an efficient and environmentally friendly process for producing clinically pure ßarteether. The process has been sold to a private party for commercial production. To date, no other party has commercialized clinically pure ß-arteether. The seven northeastern States of India, which cover the southeastern subHimalayan region, are endowed with vast resources of flora and fauna. Indeed, the region is located within the Indo-Burma “biodiversity hotspot” and is home to approximately half of the total flora of the Indian subcontinent. Located in this region, the Regional Research Laboratory (RRL), Jorhat, has emphasized the effective utilization of the natural resources of the area since its inception in 1962. Until the late 1980s, however, these activities were mainly academic in nature and resulted in the isolation of more than 150 new and diverse plant secondary metabolites and more than 100 publications in internationally renowned journals. In the early 1990s, the emphasis shifted towards the extraction and commercialization of drugs and drug intermediates from the region’s plants. Since 1997, RRL-Jorhat has been engaged in a major inter-CSIR laboratory programme, “Development and commercialization of bioactive molecules and traditional preparations from medicinal plants”. This programme uses the combination of Indian biodiversity and the traditional system of medicine as a source of many bioactive preparations and lead compounds. Already this programme has produced exciting results and several extracts with excellent bioactivity against different diseases have been identified. In the course of this work, RRL-Jorhat scientists cultivated an Indian variety of Artemisia annua (family Asteraceae) and established an extraction procedure for artemisinin, a potent antimalarial drug. Artemisinin is an unusual sesquiterpene lactone containing an endoperoxide function. Its unique chemical structure, coupled with its low toxicity and proven antimalarial activity, has attracted attention from both chemists and pharmacologists since its discovery in China in the early 1970s. The practical use of artemisinin as an antimalarial drug was impaired, however, by: • its low solubility in water and oil; • its poor efficacy by oral administration; • its short half-life in the blood; and • the high rate of recrudescence in treated patients. Studies on the structure-activity relationship of artemisinin have produced several derivatives with improved solubility and efficacy. Among these are artemether and arteether, which are already approved as antimalarial drugs in China. Despite the availability of effective antimalarial agents, a major factor that has led to the persistence of malaria is the emergence of Plasmodium strains that are resistant to one or more classes of antimalarial drug. This resistance is thought to develop as a result of spontaneous chromosomal point mutations, possibly even independently of drug pressure. Subsequently, more resistant mutants are selected under drug pressure. India is a high-risk region and urgently needs new drugs for treating patients infected with resistant strains of malaria parasites as well as people suffering from cerebral malaria, the most deadly form of the disease. As RRL-Jorhat scientists had experience in working with A. annua and artemisinin, several Indian companies approached the institute, asking for commercially viable and world-class technology to produce an effective antimalarial drug. RRL scientists have since developed novel laboratory-scale technologies for producing ß-arteether from artemisinin. In the RRL-Jorhat process, the desired ßisomer of arteether is obtained in more than 78 per cent yield of the clinically pure product. Recognizing the commercial possibilities of the institute’s knowhow, a private company, M/s FDC Ltd., Mumbai, came forward to sponsor the scaling-up of the technology. This process has been successfully completed and the technology has been transferred to the commercial sponsor.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory diseases are a major public health problem around the world, a problem that is worsening because of the increasing percentage of older people in both developed and developing countries. Traditionally, several natural products with attributed antiinflammatory properties exist, including cat´s claw (Uncaria tomentosa), the bark of which is widely used in Peru. The aim of the current project was to verify the anti-inflammatory properties using an alcoholic extract of cat’s claw and a combination of cellular and molecular experiments. Following these basic tests, clinical studies were designed to demonstrate the scientifically proven usefulness of the extract. Throughout the world, the number of people with chronic inflammatory diseases is increasing. For the most part, developed countries have the capacity to cope with this situation. In developing countries, however, there is a critical need to allocate as many resources as possible to production issues, leaving little for older people. This situation puts a large part of the population in developing countries beyond the reach of pharmaceutical products. There is, therefore, a critical requirement to develop therapeutic alternatives from readily available regional resources. Not only will such locally developed pharmaceutical products assist the elderly — and others — but their development will also reduce the amount spent on costly imported alternatives. In today’s global economy, the application of traditional knowledge can be useful. However, for a pharmaceutical product derived from a botanical source to gain wide support, its worth must be proved scientifically with data based on molecular, cellular and clinical trials in accordance with the current concepts of evidence-based medicine. \ufffd Costs Approximately US$25,000 was provided by the Immunology Section in terms of funds from different sources. Government contributions from a national project that provided some reagents and laboratory animals amounted to around US$2,000. Contributions from private funds totalled US$15,000 and provided partial support for some small projects, such as the determination of toxicity parameters. Foreign funds (US$3,000) helped to buy some experimental reagents.The Section’s own funds (around US$5,000) were used to procure consumable reagents and laboratory and office equipment. The case for cat’s claw: Peru 83 Cat’s claw (Uncaria tomentosa, family Rubiaceae) is a woody vine that can grow up to 30 metres into the forest canopy of Peru. It derives its name from the thorns that grow in pairs at regular intervals along the stem and resemble the claws of a cat (fig. 1). The plant has been exploited for its medicinal properties by various Peruvian tribes for at least 2,000 years. Traditionally, it has been used to treat such ailments as arthritis, asthma, cancer, gastric ulcers and rheumatism. It is also used to control inflammation, help to heal wounds and alleviate pain and therefore has the potential to treat a wide range of chronic inflammatory diseases, especially if the active ingredients can be identified and isolated. In addition, other, unrelated species of plants in Mexico and Latin America are commonly called cat’s claw, or uña de gato. Several of them, however, have toxic properties, making the verification and standardization of “true” cat’s claw (U. tomentosa) preparations a vital issue.",

    "abstract": "For centuries, people living at high altitudes in Peru have cultivated maca (Lepidium meyenii). The root of this plant has traditionally been used as a food source. It is also reputed to have energizing, aphrodisiac and fertility-enhancing properties. Aware of the traditional uses of maca, a Peruvian pharmaceutical company, Laboratorios Hersil, contacted the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia to carry out independent studies on the clinical effects of Gelatinized Maca, one of its commercially available products derived from dried maca roots, in healthy men. These studies — the first scientific tests to be performed on human volunteers using a pharmaceutical product derived from maca — were divided into two parts: • a 12-week double-blind, placebocontrolled, randomized trial in which different doses of Gelatinized Maca were compared with a placebo, the aim being to demonstrate any effect of the Gelatinized Maca capsules on anthropometrical, haematological, mood, energy, sexual desire and hormone parameters in apparently healthy adult men; and • a 4-month oral treatment designed to determine the effect of Gelatinized Maca on sperm and semen production in healthy adult men. At the prescribed doses, Gelatinized Maca improved mood, decreased anxiety, decreased stress, increased serum adrenal androgens, increased self-report of sexual desire, increased self-report of energy levels, and increased sperm count and sperm motility. These effects were observed in the absence of any changes in serum hormone levels. Lepidium meyenii (maca) belongs to the cabbage family (Brassicaceae). It is a perennial plant that is cultivated exclusively between 4,000 and 4,500 metres above sea level in the central Peruvian Andes. Traditionally, maca roots, which look like large radishes, have been used by Peruvians living at high altitudes as a source of nutrition as well as for its reputed energizing, aphrodisiac and fertilityenhancing properties. Evidence for the historic cultivation of maca dates back to around 1600 B.C. Bernabe Cobo, in his seventeenth century chronicle, “History of the New World”, described how, in Chinchaycocha (Junin) in the central Peruvian Andes, he found a plant named maca that improved fertility in men. During the Spanish conquest, these observations led to maca being used to improve the fertility of mares, counteracting problems induced by exposure to high altitudes. In 1961, the fertility-enhancing properties of maca were demonstrated in Of maca and men: Peru 91 experiments using rats. However, the results were never published in a peerreview journal. In 1989, the United States National Research Council labelled maca one of the “lost crops of the Incas”, and it was declared in danger of extinction as a domesticated plant in Peru. More recently, there has been something of a “maca boom” caused by an interest in its pharmaceutical properties and a growing demand for maca products in Europe, Japan and the United States. In Peru, dried maca roots are ground to a powder and commonly sold in drugstores as a medicine and food supplement to increase stamina and fertility. It is also used as a juice taken during breakfast or mixed with hard liquor. This increased demand for maca has created new markets and a new source of income for Peruvian farmers. However, there is a danger that patents granted to pharmaceutical companies in the United States, if enforced, may prevent Peruvian farmers, the true innovators of the crop, from taking advantage of the increasing worldwide interest in maca. Today’s maca crops represent centuries of repeated selection by Andean farmers, but it is only in the last 20 years that scientific researchers and Peruvian government officials have been actively testing and conserving maca seeds and varieties (fig. 1). Owing to the increasing demand for maca for both local use and export, the area planted with maca in Peru has expanded from less than 50 hectares in 1994 to 1,200 hectares in 1999. Current estimates put the area of maca being cultivated at approximately 2,000 hectares. Historically, maca cultivation was limited to the Carhuamayo-Junin and Cerro de Pasco areas, but now production has been expanded to several other parts of Peru as well as neighbouring areas of Bolivia and, further afield, in northwest Argentina. Most of the research carried out on maca in Peru has appeared in popular local publications and relates to the plant’s fertility-enhancing properties in guinea pigs, rats and sheep. Despite the fact that maca was originally described as a nutritional supplement and fertilityenhancing product, there are claims that it also has many other properties, including effects as an aphrodisiac and a tonic, and that it can help to counter anaemia, fatigue and goitre. It is also reputed to boost the immune system, restore the body’s homeostasis, and increase the level Figure 1 Black, red and yellow ecotypes of maca crop varieties. of such serum hormones as gonadotrophin, oestrogen and testosterone. In the United States, maca is often advertised as increasing energy, stamina and endurance in athletes, promoting mental clarity, treating male impotence, and helping with menstrual problems, female hormone imbalances, menopause and chronic fatigue syndrome. Several retailers use the terms “Peruvian Ginseng” or “Andean Viagra”. However, before this research programme, none of these claimed properties had been scientifically demonstrated in humans. Given the increased demand for maca in Europe, Japan and the United States, it was therefore necessary to carry out well-designed trials to demonstrate the effects of the plant. If such claims can be validated, the demand for maca is likely to increase, providing benefits for Peru, and especially the farmers in the Andean region.",

    "abstract": "The olive oil sector plays an important role in the Tunisian economy, providing both employment and export revenue. Olive production accounts for one third of the arable land area in Tunisia — some 1.6 million hectares — and in several arid areas of the country, olives are the only viable crop. Indeed, with an annual production of 170,000 tonnes, Tunisia is the world’s fourth largest producer of olive oil. In Tunisia, olive extraction is carried out using either the traditional discontinuous press process (60 per cent) or by the continuous centrifugation of a mixture of milled olives and water (40 per cent). In both systems, three phases are produced — olive oil, a solid residue and an aqueous liquid — representing 20, 30 and 50 per cent, respectively, of the total weight of the processed olives. The Tunisian olive oil industry, therefore, yields large quantities of liquid waste (an estimated 550,000 cubic metres each year), which is black and toxic and contains high concentrations of aromatic compounds. The disposal of these highly polluting olive by-products is an important environmental problem that needs to be solved. To encourage the development of feasible technology for the treatment of these wastewaters and to add value to the by-product, the Ministry of Higher Education, Scientific Research and Technology (SERST) has introduced incentives, including project funds for universities, laboratories and various other enterprises. The Laboratory of Bioprocesses was established at the Biotechnology Centre at Sfax in 1998. Within a few years, the laboratory had established itself as a pioneer in treating and adding value to agro-industrial wastes. Already, a successful preindustrial methodology has been developed based on the bioconversion of olive mill wastewater (OMW) into biogas. In addition, OMW could be a natural source of potentially useful substances. For example, high-value phytopharmaceuticals could be recovered at low cost from olive-processing by-products. One such component of OMW, hydroxytyrosol (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol) — which makes up part of the compound oleuropein — stands out as a promising bioactive compound owing to its interesting antioxidant and potentially beneficial health properties. An original process for the recovery of hydroxytyrosol from olive by-products, supported by the European Union under the INCO-MED project “NewTechOMW” and SERST (Tunisia), has been developed. This process produces 1 kilogramme of pure hydroxytyrosol from every cubic metre of olive mill wastewater. The Mediterranean region is the world’s leading olive-growing area, accounting for almost 98 per cent of global olive production. Antioxidants from olives: Tunisia 103 Archaeological evidence suggests that olive trees (Olea europaea, family Oleaceae) have been cultivated in the region since 6,000 B.C., and Mediterranean peoples have long ascribed medicinal properties to the olive leaf, including therapeutic digestive and diuretic effects, and have used it for the treatment of fevers and other ailments. Many beneficial health properties have also been ascribed to olive oil. As a major component of the Mediterranean diet, which has become widely appreciated throughout the world by consumers more attentive to both the health and nutritional aspects of food, sales of olive oil are increasing. The health benefits arising from a diet containing olive oil have been attributed to the high oleic acid content, which may affect the plasma lipid/lipoprotein profiles, and its richness in phenolic compounds that act as natural antioxidants and are thought to contribute to the prevention of heart disease, cancers and other ailments. However, the amphiphilic character of the polyphenols (meaning that they are soluble in both oil and water) results in the major proportion of the polyphenols being separated into the wastewater phase. Owing to their potential health benefits, these polyphenolic antioxidants represent an opportunity to add value to a waste product that is also an increasing environmental problem in olive-producing countries. Typically, untreated OMW is pumped into shallow pools and left to evaporate. Synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and propyl gallate are widely used in many food products within approved limits. However, there has been some discussion recently about the undesirable use of such synthetic antioxidants because of their toxic effects. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop other types of compounds to act as antioxidants. Olives, olive leaves and OMW represent a potential source of naturally occurring antioxidants. Investigations were carried out to isolate and characterize the simple phenolic compounds and flavonoids present in olives, olive leaves and OMW and to compare their antioxidant activities, with the objective of developing effective procedures for recovering potentially highadded-value phenolic compounds from olive by-products. The biological activities of the major compounds and extracts were assessed in vivo and in vitro to evaluate their antioxidant activities and their potential use as food additives and in the stabilization of refined husk oil.",

    "abstract": "In 1996, a pilot project to document the uses of Moringa stenopetala in the areas of Ethiopia where it grows widely was carried out. The survey showed that the tree is used for a variety of purposes. In most households, for example, the fresh leaves are cooked and eaten. Communities also use the roots for treating malaria and other internal health problems. Laboratory experiments conducted on the basis of the information obtained from the survey indicated that the antitrypanosomal, anti-fertility and, in particular, the antimicrobial properties of the seeds could be exploited in the production of phytopharmaceuticals. The survey also led to the establishment of an ad hoc national committee that intends to promote and popularize Moringa trees in Ethiopia. It is hoped that the efforts of the research team and other interested groups will be instrumental in developing methods to promote the sustainable exploitation of M. stenopetala as both a food source and a medicinal plant. Among the main staple crops of Ethiopia are maize, sorghum, teff (a native grain somewhat similar to millet) and wheat. People also exploit other indigenous plants, including wild banana (Ensete ventricosum), eating the starch-containing pith of the stems, and Moringa trees, the leaves of which have a distinctive strong, mus tard-like taste, contain calcium, iron and other trace minerals, and are eaten as a supplement to the major staple foods. Worldwide, some 14 species of the Moringa tree (family Moringaceae) have been described. Among these, the best studied with regard to potential medicinal uses and the identification of compounds of potential therapeutic importance, is M. oleifera, which is native to the Indian subcontinent. Based on a review of the literature concerning M. oleifera, a project was developed to investigate the traditional uses of M. stenopetala, a species that grows widely in southern parts of Ethiopia (fig. 1). As well as being eaten, M. stenopetala, also known as aleko or shiferaw among local communities, has a variety of uses, many of them medicinal. Thus, as with M. oleifera, there is good potential to exploit the plant both as a nutritious food supplement and to isolate and characterize lead compounds for pharmaceutical product development.

    "abstract": "In Kenya and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, traditional herbal medicines are commonly used to treat a range of diseases. Such practices are especially widespread in rural areas where access to modern health care facilities is limited and the cost of modern pharmaceuticals is beyond the means of most people. In addition, there are very few effective drugs available for treating some of the most common ailments in these areas, including asthma, HIV/AIDS, malaria and typhoid. Medicines derived from indigenous Kenyan plants, however, have long been used to treat these and other diseases. Therefore, a clinic was established outside the university gates, offering treatments based on natural herbal products. Patients suffering from such common diseases as those listed above plus diabetes, hypertension, ulcers and others were provided with herbal remedies and checks were made of their progress. Initially, some 100 people were treated, many of whom were referred to the clinic by modern health practitioners. Since then, the clinic has treated thousands of individuals. In 1999, the faculty of science at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) agreed that the only way to control and treat debilitating tropical diseases such as malaria and typhoid was through the application of scientific research. At the same time, it was realized that most of the chronic diseases, including those resistant to existing conventional drugs, could be cured using traditional herbal medicines. To tackle this issue, the university collaborated with the Kenya Medical Research Institute to establish the Institute of Tropical Research on Medicines for Infectious Diseases within the university. The new institution’s remit was to train master’s and doctoral students, mainly in the field of alternative medicines, with the aim of developing new drugs from the many indigenous medicinal plants available in Kenya. However, even if such drugs were to be developed, the majority of Kenyans living in rural areas are poor and cannot afford to attend hospitals or purchase expensive conventional drugs. There was a need, therefore, for the university to develop links with traditional healers to develop inexpensive and reliable herbal medicines for a variety of common ailments. Responding to this need, staff in the Department of Botany, JKUAT, began the systematic identification of those plants used in traditional herbal medicines, collecting medicinal materials from the field and preparing medicines and dispensing them to patients. Among the main challenges faced was the accurate determination of the correct dosage to prescribe to patients. Also, as the herbal clinic was a new con Establishing a herbal clinic: Kenya 121 cept in Kenya, it faced a great deal of resistance from practitioners of modern medicine and needed to obtain formal registration from government officials.",

    "abstract": "Research on traditional medicine in Rwanda began in 1972 and was formalized in 1982 with the creation of the Centre Pharmacopée, which has since been renamed the Centre for Research in Phytomedicines and Life Sciences. The overall aim of the project is to exploit local plant species and traditional botanical knowledge. The main objectives are to: • promote Rwandan traditional medicine; • investigate the botany and agronomy of the flora traditionally used in Rwandan herbal medicine; • research the efficacy of medicinal plants used to treat both infectious and non-infectious diseases; • study Rwanda’s aromatic plants and, it is hoped, exploit their essential oils; • develop techniques for producing medicines, pesticides and other products from local plants for commercial sale; and • develop a national pharmacopoeia for Rwanda. Since the start of the project, ten medicines and several herbal teas have been made available on the local market and a technology for extracting essential oils has been developed. In the wider community, the project has helped to improve the way of life of the local population by providing low-cost medicinal products and a market for the cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants. Prior to the implementation of this project, it was demonstrated that, at any given moment, the Rwandan health care system was unable to deal with the overall medical situation in the country. In addition, approximately 80 per cent of the population consulted tradipracticians rather than medical doctors. It was decided, therefore, that the contribution of traditional medicine to the country’s health care system should be evaluated scientifically. At the time, however, Rwandan traditional medicine was regarded more as a “magical art” than as a science. The tradipractician was a lay person who would serve the needs of a small number of villagers, and people did not believe that the nation’s flora could be used for anything other than for fuel, decoration or building animal shelters. As qualified doctors did not believe that herbal medicines could play an important role in the primary health care, tradipracticians were regarded as liars. Also, some tradipracticians were unaware that certain medicinal plants could be toxic or that their administration could induce adverse effects. Among the needs that stimulated the creation of the Centre for Research in Phytomedicines and Life Sciences were: • improving people’s accessibility to health care; • reducing the cost of some essential drugs to counteract the weak purchasing power of the population; Validating traditional knowledge: Rwanda 129 • verifying the efficacy and safety of traditional phytopharmaceuticals; • improving people’s knowledge of and confidence in traditional medicine; • increasing public access to traditional medicines and tradipracticians; • enhancing the capacity of traditional medicines to treat various diseases, including asthma, diabetes and hepatitis; and • producing phytopharmaceutical remedies as good as or better than currently used modern medicines. With such a wide remit, a team of specialists was required to carry out the research: • biologists: including: – botanists: Ethnobotanical studies of medicinal plants, and – microbiologists: In vitro tests and study of the biological activities of the plant extracts; • agronomists: Preparation of a botanical garden and selection of the species to be maintained. Rare and endangered species, together with plants found in areas far from the research centre, are cultivated in the botanical garden; • chemists: Phytochemical studies, including screening of medicinal plants, chemical analyses, determination of correct doses, extraction and analysis of active ingredients, and studies on the properties of traditional remedies; • medical doctors: Disease diagnosis and clinical follow-up of patients; • technical personnel: Maintenance of laboratory equipment and other technical support; and • administrative personnel: Human and financial management.",

    "abstract": "Bilharzia, or schistosomiasis, is a disease caused by parasitic blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma. Throughout the tropics and subtropics, up to 300 million people are infected, making bilharzia second only to malaria in terms of its socio-economic and public health importance in these areas. A collaborative project involving the Swaziland Institute for Research in Traditional Medicine, Medicinal and Indigenous Food Plants (SIREMIFOP), the Bilharzia Unit of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the School of Environmental Sciences and Development of the University of Potchefstroom, South Africa and Legesse Wolde-Yohannes, an endod specialist from Ethiopia, together with rural development centres in Ntfonjeni Inkhundla and Manzini North Inkhundla has been initiated. It is a community outreach project involving the cultivation of endod (Phytolacca dodecandra) for the control of bilharzia in rural communities where the disease is endemic. The two rural communities participate in the cultivation of endod, prepare a powder from the harvest of berries, and apply given doses of the powder to ponds infested with bilharzia-transmitting snails. The outreach programme has also been extended to field workers, who are given the task of controlling parasitic diseases in the country and of providing technical know-how on the epidemiology of diseases. Throughout the project, research findings have been applied at the grassroots level using simple, unsophisticated technology for the benefit of local communities. Bilharzia, or schistosomiasis, is a parasitic disease that affects some 200 to 300 million people in the tropics and subtropics. Among human parasitic diseases, schistosomiasis ranks second only to malaria in terms of socio-economic and public health importance in the 74 countries where it is endemic. Among these countries is Swaziland, where the disease is common in rural communities. Indeed, it is now known that the disease is increasing in both distribution and intensity, partly owing to the creation of new water resources to meet the increasing demand for agricultural irrigation. The disease is caused by trematodes, also known as flatworms or blood flukes, of the genus Schistosoma. Several Schistosoma species infect humans, the most important of which are S. haematobium, S. japonicum, S. mansoni and S. mekongi. In southern Africa, S. matheei, typically a parasite of cattle, goats and sheep, also sometimes infects humans. Three species are prevalent in Swaziland: S. mansoni, which causes intestinal schistosomiasis, S. haematobium, which causes urinary schistosomiasis, and S. matheei. Battling bilharzia: Swaziland 137 To complete their life cycle, the Schistosoma parasites require an intermediate host, which is typically an aquatic snail. In Swaziland, the intermediate snail host for S. haematobium is Bulinus (Physopsis) africanus, which is common in the middleveld (around 675 metres above sea level) and lowveld (around 250 metres above sea level) but is found only rarely in the highveld (1,400 metres above sea level). The intermediate snail host for S. mansoni is Biomphalaria pfeifferi, which is prevalent in the lowveld. The Lymnaea natalensis snail, an intermediate host for the cattle liver fluke, was also included in the project because of the cultural and commercial importance of cattle in Swaziland. After developing and reproducing in the intermediate snail host, larval stages known as cercariae are released into the water. These microscopic, free-swimming larvae actively seek out a human host and burrow through the skin. They then migrate to the liver where they develop to maturity. Once mature, they move to the blood vessels of the intestines or the urinary bladder, causing intestinal and urinary schistosomiasis, respectively. The disease symptoms depend on the species of parasite involved and may include diarrhoea, fatigue and fever as well as damage to the bladder, liver and spleen. Heavy infections can also be fatal and have been implicated as a cause of cancer. Worldwide, schistosomiasis control has been based on a combination of several methods, including the treatment of infected people with such synthetic drugs as metrifonate, oxamniquine and praziquantel; educating people in hygienic preventive measures that can be taken against the disease; and the use of molluscicides to kill the intermediate snail hosts and thus break the parasite’s life cycle. The use of molluscicides for the control of the disease is also important as, unlike the use of synthetic drugs, it prevents the reinfection of people after treatment. Figure 1 Endod berries, the source of the molluscicidal saponins. One commonly used molluscicide is the synthetic bayluscicide. However, several plant-derived molluscicides have also proven useful. Naturally occurring molluscicides have been obtained from such species as Phytolacca dodecandra (endod, family Phytolaccaceae), Swartzia madagascariensis (a tree in the family Caesalpinaceae), Tetrapleura tetraptera (family Fabaceae), and Urginea epigea (family Hyacinthaceae). Of these, P. dodecandra has been shown to be the most effective and is widely used in other African countries such as Ethiopia. The molluscicidal properties of endod result from the saponin content of the berries (fig. 1). Previously, the University of Swaziland, in collaboration with other institutions from Canada, Ethiopia, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe, investigated some aspects of the use of endod. The current case study highlights the application of the findings of these previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Heantos is an anti-drug medication and associated therapy originating in Vietnamese traditional medicine. Its development has been based on two phases: • the development of a medicinal preparation derived from traditional knowledge and experience in coping with addiction to opium and opiate-based drugs; and • the scientific development of this preparation in terms of proving its effectiveness and the development of a standardized product. The development of Heantos from Vietnamese traditional medicine was initiated by Tran Khuong Dan in the 1980s. He was responsible for collecting more than 100 recipes based on published material on traditional Vietnamese and Chinese medicinal plants as well as the experiences and practices of several minority groups in Viet Nam that cope with drug addiction. Tran Khuong Dan studied, blended and refined these recipes into what is now known as Heantos. His concoction proved to be safe and more efficacious than other traditionally used preparations and recipes. During 1990 and 1991, Tran Khuong Dan’s concoction underwent an official evaluation by the Ministry of Public Health in Viet Nam that confirmed its safety and efficacy but that did not result in its authorization and introduction into the public health system, primarily owing to the lack of standardization. The evaluation also recommended more clinical trials, which have resulted in the treatment of thousands of patients. A more scientific approach to the development of this preparation was initiated in late 1995. Although these studies will not be completed until 2006, the project has already been marked by various successful stages: • development and formulation of a scientific strategy and operational procedure; \ufffd Costs Total: US$2.9 million, including: • contributions by various United Nations organizations: US$960,000; • extrabudgetary contributions to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) by Norway: US$440,000; • foreign government contributions: US$450,000; • individual foreign contributions: US$550,000; and • in-kind contributions by the Government of Viet Nam equivalent to US$500,000. Fighting addiction: Viet Nam 147 • identification of independent, internationally renowned scientific institutes and the establishment of international scientific collaboration; • chemical investigation of Heantos using modern research methods; • substantiation of the safety and efficacy claims of Heantos in compliance with scientific standards; • optimization of the original preparation and development into a standardized product; • (limited) application of Heantos as an anti-drug treatment; and • translation of the innovative experience into a case study/model for the scientific development of a traditional medicine. Viet Nam has a long history of dealing with opium addiction that has led to the development, particularly by minority groups throughout the country, of various traditional recipes. The initiative of Tran Khuong Dan in the early 1980s to develop an anti-drug preparation on the basis of traditional knowledge resulted in a more systematic process compared to the conventional development of preparations of traditional medicine. However, his preparation of Heantos did not differ much from other traditional medicine products as it was still an inadequately standardized liquid. Even so, it was subjected to an official evaluation under the Ministry of Public Health, which confirmed its safety and efficacy in clinical trials but also indicated its limitations. As a result, it was not officially introduced into the public health system. The concoction was made available, however, and was used to treat thousands of drug addicts over the following years — albeit outside the close control of clinical trials — generating anecdotal data of its efficacy. The increasing problem of drug addiction in Viet Nam, allied to the evaluation of Heantos and its subsequent informal use, played a crucial role in the decision of the Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) to pursue the scientific development of the preparation. Other considerations and justifications for the involvement of VAST were that: • the potential of Heantos and its Vietnamese ownership needed to be protected; • the project provided an opportunity to create the scientific conditions that would favour Vietnamese control of the further development of the product and its planned commercial production; and • the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) had favourably responded to the request for support for the initiative. This final point offered the prospect not only of financial support but also access to the independent expertise of the United Nations system, its support in networking with the international scientific community, and its impartial protection and observance of ethical principles, including the protection of intellectual property.

    "abstract": "Bulbuls fritillariae cirrhosae is one of the most widely used traditional Chinese medicines with the function of relieving coughs and eliminating phlegm. In the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, “bulbuls fritillariae cirrhosae” refers to the bulbs of four species. Fritillaria cirrhosa — the tendril-leaf fritillary (fig. 1) — is the most widely used, but F. unibracteata, F. przewalskii and F. delavayi are recognized as suitable alternatives. The manufacture of fritillaria preparations has developed into a large-scale industry worth an estimated US$400 million a year in China, and there are currently more than 400 manufacturers producing over 200 kinds of fritillaria preparations. Even so, the demand for fritillaria products is growing fast and the annual output covers only some five per cent of the market demand. Cultivation techniques are still unsuccessful, however, and most fritillaria is collected from wild populations which, as a result, are declining rapidly. The Institute of Medicinal Plant Development (IMPLAD) has therefore developed a two-pronged approach to the sustainable use of fritillaria resources. First, in a break from traditional methods of cultivating medicinal plants, a system for cultivating F. cirrhosa in its natural environment has been developed. This marks the first time such a largescale “natural fostering” system has been used to protect and sustainably use an endangered medicinal plant. Second, species in the same genus as F. cirrhosa have been investigated as possible alternative sources of bulbuls fritillariae cirrhosae. Five species in particular have been analysed and found to contain chemical components similar to those of F. cirrhosa with similar pharmacological and curative activities. These alternative species are also easier to cultivate than F. cirrhosa and could become useful substitutes for F. cirrhosa, helping to satisfy the market demand for the popular remedy. The unsustainable use of herbal medicine resources is one of the most important obstacles hindering the further development of phytopharmaceutical products. In 2002, eight Chinese ministries and committees issued the “Outline of Modernized Development of Chinese Medicine (2002-2010)”. The report listed the sustainable use of Chinese medicines and development of the traditional medi Figure 1 The tendril leaf fritillary, Fritillaria cirrhosa, the bulbs of which provide the source of bulbuls fritillariae cirrhosae, a traditional Chinese cough medicine. Sustaining herbal supplies: China 159 cine industry as basic principles. “While fully utilizing the resources, we must pay attention to protecting the resource and the environment”, continued the report. “We must also protect biodiversity and ecological balance, especially to recover and regenerate those Chinese medicine material resources that are seriously threatened or in short supply.” The report also further emphasizes the protection and sustainable utilization of Chinese traditional medicine resources as one of the six “key tasks” to be addressed over the next few years. Responding to these issues, development and research into bulbuls fritillariae cirrhosae have recently been accorded special priority. In the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, bulbuls fritillariae cirrhosae - a popular remedy for coughs and phlegm - refers to the bulbs of Fritillaria cirrhosa, F. unibracteata, F. przewalskii and F. delavayi, and all four species have been listed in the Wild Officinal Species under Protection of the State according to Wild Medicine Material Protection Rules issued by the Chinese State Council. In China, these fritillaria resources, and F. cirrhosa in particular, are becoming seriously threatened. Shortages in supply mean that, although the annual output of bulbuls fritillariae cirrhosae has reached about 100,000 kilogrammes, it is far from meeting the current market demand of about 2 million kilogrammes. Bulbuls fritillariae cirrhosae, therefore, is becoming one of the most expensive Chinese herbal medicines, with prices for the best-quality material reaching as much as US$100 per kilogramme. To strengthen the conservation and sustainable use of Chinese herbal medicine resources, IMPLAD has developed a research programme aimed at the conservation and cultivation of wild plant medicinal materials, the results of which should benefit not only China but also the rest of the world.",

    "abstract": "The project was designed to facilitate the development of commercial pharmaceutical products based on indigenous plants of the Caribbean. Countrywide information on medicinal plants was collected and many local plants were investigated for their biologically active compounds for eventual production of nutraceutical and/or pharmaceutical products. Genebanks were established for the main species and tissue culture was used — often after developing species-specific protocols in the laboratory — for conservation and propagation purposes. Hot pepper was chosen as a suitable crop for promotion within the small island States of the Caribbean as even 0.005 hectare has proven to be an economic unit. This crop is priced well in the market and is growing in demand both as a spice and for its therapeutic properties. Neem (Azadirachta indica) was also chosen as a flagship plant for development owing to its potential applications in both medicine and agriculture. Neem oil was tested for its antimicrobial activity and agriculturally useful formulations (biopesticides and a disinfectant) were tested. This project was innovative mainly because it was multifaceted and aimed at strengthening existing or newly established biotechnology-related research teams throughout the Caribbean that could then sustain the initiative beyond the duration of the project. Since its inception in 1948, the University of the West Indies (UWI) has been extracting, identifying and analysing biologically active ingredients found in Jamaican plants. Many such natural products have been isolated, their structure elucidated and their bioactivity identified. Pharmacological trials have also been carried out on selected compounds and a few patents have been issued. Among these are products developed from ganja (Cannabis sativum) and an extract from spirit weed (Eryngium foetidum) active against Strongyloides, a parasitic worm. However, previous research carried by UWI has not been thoroughly collated and many aspects of research and development required for the sustainable use of local plants were being neglected. The inherently rich biodiversity of the Caribbean island States presents many opportunities, and governments in the region recognize that the conservation and wise use of environmental resources — including indigenous and locally grown plants — are crucial for sustainable economic development. However, over the years, malpractice, the neglect of the environment and the poor management of natural resources have combined to deplete many indigenous species and several important ecosystems have been degraded. The wise use of biological diversity must be preceded by gaining a knowledge of the species with commercial potential. However, knowledge about local plants is incomplete. There is also a need to preserve indigenous medicinal plants, many of which are vulnerable to extinction, threatened or rare, and to improve varieties of many cultivated species. The application of biotechnological tools can provide modern and reliable methods for supporting the exploitation of the Caribbean’s rich biodiversity. Therefore, this project was designed by the Biotechnology Centre at UWI to encourage the use of its biotechnology capacity — including molecular biology and tissue culture skills — to enable the collection, identification, conservation, characterization and documentation of the gene pools of locally important endemic and indigenous plants as a basis for the further development of commercially viable products from Caribbean plants. The project was also geared towards strengthening research capabilities — both at UWI and in collaborating institutions — which was especially needed in the identification of plant extracts and formulations with economic potential.",

    "abstract": "Saint John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), used to treat mild depression, is the most widely sold herbal remedy in the United States and Europe. However, the active ingredient, hypericin, is present in several other Hypericum species. NCARTT has therefore undertaken preliminary work to develop Hypericum triquetrifolium — a species found growing wild in Jordan — into a commercial product. The hypericin content of methanol extracts of dried flowers, leaves, stems and roots of Hypericum triquetrifolium was determined. Exposure of the samples to light for 30 minutes immediately before analysis resulted in the conversion of protohypericin to hypericin and helped to improve yields. The highest content of hypericin was found in the leaves (0.36 per cent by weight). These relatively high values for the hypericin content of H. triquetrifolium are encouraging and further studies will focus on the introduction, cultivation and biological evaluation of other Hypericum species in Jordan. St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) is currently listed in the official pharmacopeias of several European countries. Extracts are used as an antidepressant as well as to treat bed-wetting and nightmares in children. In addition, the plant has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and pain-modulating properties. Retroviruses, in particular the HIV/AIDS virus, are susceptible to extracts of St. John’s wort. Indeed, the plant’s medicinal properties have been known since the time of the ancient Greeks. In the Middle Ages, H. perforatum was believed to have the power to ward off evil and protect against disease. Its major use today, however, is in the treatment of depression. Depression ranks as one of the most common health conditions and affects 80 per cent of people during at least part of their life. Some 17 million people suffer from major depression and hundreds of millions suffer from mild to moderate forms of the affliction. Currently, the leading synthetic anti-depressant drug is Prozac®. In Germany, Prozac® is prescribed to some 300,000 patients a month. In comparison, the leading herbal remedy for depression, Saint John’s wort or hypericum, is prescribed to more than 200,000 patients a month. In fact, St. John’s wort is the most widely sold herbal remedy in the United States and Europe and has a market value of more than US$400 million a year. The plant, therefore, can be a profitable crop. In 2000, after a surge in demand, the Ministry of Agriculture, British Columbia, Canada, released a report encouraging farmers to invest in growing St. John’s wort and reported that one hectare could produce more than 2,000 kilogrammes and that a kilogramme of dried St. John’s wort could fetch around US$15. Focus on local alternatives: Jordan 179 According to the report, after deducting major expenses, the net income from this investment would approach US$15,000 per hectare. Recent analyses attribute the pharmacological activity of H. perforatum to a variety of compounds, including pseudohypericin, hyperfolin flavonoids and, in particular, hypericin. One milligramme of purified hypericin costs about US$100. However, H. perforatum is not the only source of hypericin. Some 370 Hypericum species (family Hypericaceae) occur naturally in Europe, western Asia, north Africa and Australia. Five species, H. hyssopifolium, H. languinosum, H. olivieri, H. serpyllifolium and H. triquetrifolium, are found in Jordan. H. triquetrifolium (known as Peter’s wort, wavy leaf St. John’s wort or tangled hypericum and, in Jordan, as Roja) grows in northern parts of the country around Ajlun, Irbid and Ramtha and is often regarded as a weed. It has traditionally been used as a sedative, astringent, antispasmodic, and for intestinal and bile disorders. Antiinflammatory and pain-relieving properties have also been reported. Given that the hypericin content in both H. perforatum and H. triquetrifolium is similar, Jordan’s wild-growing Roja could emerge as very valuable medicinal crop plant (fig. 1). Despite its uses and potential as a lucrative crop, little research has been carried out on H. triquetrifolium. A longterm project, including a comprehensive phytochemical study to identify the active constituents and their concentration in H. triquetrifolium, is required. In addition, studies to determine its safety and efficacy for mild to moderate depression, first in mice and later in controlled clinical trials, will be necessary. Botanical and agronomical investigations also need to be conducted to characterize the plant, study its natural habitat, and develop the best methods for its cultivation. As a preliminary step, NCARRT scientists have used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the hypericin content of the flowers, leaves, stems and roots of H. triquetrifolium.",

    "abstract": "Jordan's main geographical features—the Jordan Rift Valley (including the Dead Sea basin), the forested highlands and the Badia or eastern desert—create a variety of very different ecosystems and environments. The country has four distinct biogeographic zones: Mediterranean, Irano-Turanian, subtropical African and Saharo-Arabian. At the same time, its geographical position at the crossroads of Africa, Asia and Europe has made it a centre for the extensive exchange of both natural and cultural resources. Its plentiful archaeological remains bear witness to a long and varied history that includes Egyptian, Hellenistic, Islamic and Roman influences and that stretches back into prehistory. Today, 90 per cent of the land area is desert that is unfit for cultivation and most of the 4.5 million people live in the highland region where the level of agro-biodiversity is highest. As in many other areas of the world, however, population pressure, with its increased demand for natural resources, pollution, and the introduction of exotic species are among the factors causing a loss of biodiversity in Jordan. With habitats being destroyed and wild species becoming extinct, ways of protecting and sustainably using the remaining resources need to be developed. 23",

    "abstract": "The main aim of the initiatives described in this report was to assess the reasons for biodiversity loss in Jordan, specifically in the Badia region (eastern plateau), which covers about three quarters of the total land area. The Badia, which is the main rangeland area of Jordan, is flat and arid, with long, hot dry summers and an annual average rainfall of 100 millimetres. It is part of the Syrian Desert on the northwest edge of the Arabian Desert and its vegetation is classed as Saharo-Arabian-Sindian. The northern part of the Badia region is far richer in biodiversity than the south, mainly because of the massive Azraq Basin and oasis and the higher rainfall. It has a low population density and there is good potential for the development of such natural resources as mineral deposits, surface and groundwater sources, renewable natural rangelands for animal production, and sites of natural beauty and interest. In addition, there are excellent opportunities for exploiting wind and solar power to provide non-polluting, renewable energy. The area's valuable mineral deposits include phosphate, white cement, limestone, quartz, clay, marble, natural gas, non-commercial oil and oil shale. The area also includes nine of the 27 important bird areas in the country, according to Birdlife International guidelines. Since 1977, scientists have been collecting samples from 29 different habitats and localities and all collected specimens have been deposited with the Department of Biological Sciences of the University of Jordan Museum, Amman, and the Jordan Natural History Museum at Yarmouk University, Irbid. Photographic surveys have been carried out. Reports and articles resulting from these surveys have been published, including a checklist of the flora of the Badia. As a result, there is now a wealth of information that makes it possible to assess the changes in bird, plant and mammal populations. If a population is seen to be declining, for example, scientists now have the data required to try to determine the reasons for the decline. From this, they are able to devise both general and speciesspecific recommendations for protecting the biodiversity of Jordan. The following in-depth case study on the Azraq Wetland Reserve provides a good model for natural resources management in arid zones.",

    "abstract": "The Chilean sclerophyllous forest, located in the semi-arid region of the country, is characterized by trees with small, tough evergreen leaves. The Chilean palm (Jubaea chilensis) is one of the forest's most beautiful endemic species. It grows to as much as 35 metres in height and 2 metres in diameter and has leaves that are 4 to 5 metres long. It is also the longest-living palm species in the world, with a life expectancy of up to 2,000 years. However, this longevity makes the palm particularly vulnerable. For a start, it must survive a long period as a fragile seedling or juvenile plant that grows extremely slowly, taking up to 15 years to reach a height of 1.5 metres. In addition, it does not produce any fruit for the first 80 to 120 years of its life, which makes it very difficult to regenerate successfully. The Chilean palm is, however, highly resistant to fire damage and drought and can survive minimum temperatures of -18°C. In the wild, it grows in the semi-arid region of Chile, between the Limari and Mataquito rivers, mostly in coastal and coastal mountain range areas. Since pre-Columbian times, people have been harvesting its nutritious, pleasant-tasting nuts, and it also produces a sweet honey-like sap, which is harvested by cutting the top off the tree. The sap is exuded for the next four to twelve months, but the tree ultimately dies. Such sap harvest 35 ing is another major cause of the decline of Chilean palm populations. Owing to its ornamental beauty, the tree is cultivated in the United Kingdom, Mediterranean Europe, California and other parts of the world. Chilean palm populations are dwindling rapidly and dramatically. Of the estimated five million specimens at the time of the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century, only about 120,000 remain, dispersed among seven scattered and geographically isolated areas. Although there are over 4,000 species of palm worldwide, the Chilean palm is the only representative of the genus Jubaea and if it dies out, so, too, does the entire genus. Apart from honey-harvesting, other main reasons for the palm's decline in numbers are: a growing demand for agricultural land; cattle grazing, which prevents young plants from growing; nut harvesting, which reduces the species' natural regeneration capacity; and a lack of plantations. The Chilean palm is not the only sclerophyllous forest species at risk. However, it is considered a species that is emblematic of Chile's semi-arid ecosystems. The Chilean palm can, therefore, be considered as a kind of protective shield for such fragile ecosystems and can be used to promote the protection of its surrounding environments. For these reasons, the recovery of the palm throughout its former distribution range was seen as a valuable aid to the protection and recovery of the other vulnerable flora and fauna of Chile's sclerophyllous forests.",

    "abstract": "About one third of Tunisia's agricultural land is rangeland, most of which (80 per cent) has an arid or semi-arid climate and mean annual rainfall of less than 350 millimetres. This area used to be home to one of the highest diversities of plant species in northern Africa. By the late 1980s, however, the destruction of natural habitats and the effects of ever-increasing numbers of grazing livestock were leading to a rapid decline in plant species diversity. Overgrazing accelerates the disappearance of species that are grazed and aids the spread of species that are not grazed. In some areas, the result has been desertification of once-fertile areas. Attempts to introduce exotic species as a way of restoring and improving degraded rangelands have not been particularly successful and attention is now turning to indigenous pastoral plants. In 1986, a gene bank of indigenous arid and desert rangeland plant species was created at the Institut des régions arides (IRA, or Arid Regions Institute) in Médenine, Tunisia. This programme is a national priority and has received financial support from the national government as well as from international, regional and national institutions. The gene bank has been included within the frameworks of both the National Strategy to Combat Desertification and the National Programme for 41 Biodiversity Conservation, and its main objectives are to: • safeguard and conserve the multiple-use genetic resources of arid and desert zones; • collect plant material that can be characterized and assessed in order to select the most promising accessions; and • domesticate the most promising taxa. These objectives are interrelated: conservation provides the opportunity to domesticate species, while domestication helps to ensure that a species will be conserved. In turn, domestication makes it possible to exploit species commercially and sustainably, while characterization and assessment support the sustainable conservation of species.",

    "abstract": "Some 90 million hectares of Brazil's northeastern region are classed as \"semi-arid\" and periodically suffer from prolonged droughts. Although the regular droughts severely damage the local economy, the region's characteristic caatinga brushwood flora survives well in the shallow, infertile soil. Caatinga vegetation is a rich complex of deciduous woody and annual herbaceous species. Many of these provide forage to herds of goats; as a result, valuable species are being overgrazed and are becoming replaced by less desirable herbs and shrubs. As forage for goats becomes scarcer, local farmers are switching to raising cattle, which is having an even more devastating effect on the environment as the animals eat what they can and trample much of the rest. In some of Brazil's northeastern states, 15 per cent of the caatinga has already become desert. The current situation, therefore, with some 26 million head of cattle, 10.4 million goats and 7.5 million sheep, is unsustainable as it is destroying biodiversity and the natural environment. It is also very low yielding for the farmers. The cattle reproduction rate is around 40 per cent, 30 per cent lower than what should be achievable; the calf mortality rate is 15 per cent; and animals reach a weight of about 340 kilogrammes in four to five 49 years compared to the goal of 420 kilogrammes in three years. For goats, the interval between pregnancies is often more than 300 days and kid mortality is 35 per cent. Farmers' dependency on the very caatinga that their herds are destroying is the main reason for these poor yields, especially in periods of drought when caatinga forage becomes particularly scarce. Although caatinga may support animals during the rainy season, during the annual six to eight months of drought, vegetation is reduced by 60 per cent. The situation is exacerbated as only about one third of the area's 1.5 million farm properties have sufficient water resources to see them through these droughts. Another third are at risk of collapse if the regular rains arrive a month later than expected. The final 500,000 farmers are completely dependent on regular rains for their water and thus are the worst hit by drought, which often forces them to walk up to 6 kilometres to collect water or, in some cases, to abandon their homesteads altogether. Migratory farmers also burn forest and brushwood in order to create fields for the production of subsistence crops. As the area's population grows and the existing landownership system forces more and more people to move into new areas, this practice is increasing. Wood extraction for industrial use, fuel or charcoal production is also having a devastating affect on the area's biodiversity. Maps drawn up using the latest satellite technologies reveal the extent of the environmental degradation that has occurred in the area. Using these maps and other resources, the scientific community implemented an awareness-raising and information-sharing campaign and has encouraged local people to appreciate the importance of sustainable economic development that does not damage natural habitats. Worldwide concern over the issue has also helped to focus attention on this area of Brazil. There have also been failed attempts to introduce alternative sources of fodder for the animal herd. Among the reasons for their failure are: the small size of farms, the legal system that governs farmers' ownership of the land, the absence of farmers' associations, and the lack of access to bank credit and government technical support. In contrast, the caatinga-buffel-leucaena (CBL) farming system makes use of native forages derived from caatinga vegetation and other ecosystems. When implemented correctly, it has the potential to increase herd yield statistics and, hence, the sustainability of farming in the region by increasing the economic returns on livestock production.",

    "abstract": "The economy of Jamaica, the third largest island in the Caribbean, is based on agriculture, aluminium and bauxite exports, tourism, light manufacturing and financial services. Although the climate is generally tropical and humid, the area to the south of the highlands that cross the island from east to west has lower rainfall than the area to the north and this has significant consequences for the types of agriculture practised in the two areas. The southeastern section of the parish of St. Elizabeth is home to some 150,000 inhabitants and covers over 1,200 square kilometres of the semi-arid zone of southwestern Jamaica. As with the rest of the country, St. Elizabeth has two periods of high rainfall—from April to June and from September to October—which alternate with the long (November to March) and short (July to August) dry periods. Local soils tend to drain very quickly and are therefore susceptible to drought and erosion, so the regular rains do not provide enough soil moisture for crop production to be practised throughout the year. Additional water, therefore, must be supplied from rainwater storage and from sources outside the area. In recent years, this situation has been exacerbated by the late or non-arrival of the spring rains and the reduced frequency of the autumn ones, which has had a 54 Dryland farming: Jamaica 55 detrimental effect on crops, livestock and infrastructure. Despite these difficulties, farmers in the St. Elizabeth area have developed profitable and sustainable agricultural practices.",

    "abstract": "More than 80 per cent of the people living in Africa depend on plant- and animal-based medicines to satisfy their health-care requirements. In Kenya, 90 per cent of the population have used medicinal plants at least once. Among the main reasons for this dependence on medicinal plant resources are rural people's lack of access to modern medical services, the high costs of these services and medicines, and the holistic and cultural values that rural communities attach to traditional plant cures. Many indigenous plants have been scientifically tested and found to have medicinal properties that can be used in Westernstyle medicine. Such cures are particularly suitable for use in rural communities as inexpensive, sustainable and culturally appropriate alternatives to more expensive conventional treatments. As a result, ethnomedicine is being promoted and supported as a way of providing efficacious medicines for people in less developed areas. However, the systematic use of natural plant resources for rural communities faces several challenges. For a start, environmentally damaging practices such as forest clearance for agriculture, uncontrolled burning, timber logging and livestock grazing all destroy the habitats in which medicinal plants flourish. Local people's supplies of medicinal plants are also being reduced by 60 Use of medicinal plants: Kenya 61 competition with large-scale commercial harvesters, who extract the plants for export to pharmaceutical companies in other countries. In addition, many of the most useful species are vulnerable because they reproduce slowly, are slow growing or have very limited distributions and require very specific habitats.",

    "abstract": "The Sahelian zone of West Africa suffers from a short rainy season, which puts many natural resources, including forest trees, at risk. To counter deforestation, large-scale plantations and social forestry and agroforestry initiatives are being implemented throughout the region. Such programmes help to restore degraded ecosystems, prevent the loss of biodiversity and contribute to poverty alleviation. As rainfall is unreliable, the saplings and young trees grown for these initiatives need to be raised in protected tree nurseries. To optimize the production of saplings in these nurseries, the Centre national de semences forestières (CNSF, or National Tree Seed Centre) of Burkina Faso has developed a research programme focusing on species from the area's arid and semi-arid zones. Since the 1980s, most nurseries have been raising saplings in plastic bags, but this practice has two main drawbacks: the bags are expensive for the rural farmers who are producing young trees and, as they are not biodegradable, they add to environmental pollution. CNSF set out to develop alternative containers that are cheaper and that can be manufactured from local materials following traditional local methods. These experiments resulted in the production of an earthenware container.

    "abstract": "Communication is an essential part of human activity. By sharing knowledge and experiences with others, people can often help to develop new ways of doing things and new tools that lead to greater productivity, improved protection and conservation of resources, and higher living standards. For communication to be effective, however, it is essential that the information transmitted be reliable. Information and communication are often even more critical for sustainable development than are actual material resources as, among other things, they empower people, giving them a voice in society and government. However, although communications technology has developed rapidly in recent years, many rural people, especially in developing countries, do not have access to modern methods of information transfer. In many developing countries, for example, the telecommunications infrastructure does not extend beyond the major cities. This is because of a combination of factors, including the gap between the high cost of new technology and the low income and education levels of rural people, and language and cultural barriers that make it difficult or impossible for some people to use any information supplied. As a result, many societies in developing countries are missing out on local, regional and global developments. The longer a community is 71 cut off from the communications highway, the harder it will be for this community to catch up by learning how to use and maintain modern communications infrastructure and equipment. Rural communities are also particularly vulnerable to the potentially devastating effects of certain—even apparently insignificant—weather conditions that can now be reliably forecast. However, these are the very people who are often overlooked in national-level weather and climate information systems. Even local extension workers and hydro-meteorological offices often lack access to up-todate climate and weather technology. Meteorological information is particularly important because the weather affects a wide range of human activities such as agriculture, disaster mitigation, energy production, health, natural resources management and transport. For example, advances in climate- and weather-related technologies are making it easier to prepare for natural disasters; they can also highlight windows of opportunity for bumper harvests, energy surpluses and other benefits. This case study demonstrates how, by taking into account people's needs, including the provision of radio broadcasts in their own languages, the use of complex climate models and state-of-theart satellite technology can make a difference to people's lives, even in areas considered among the least developed in the world.",

    "abstract": "The Kenyan economy depends on agriculture for economic growth, employment and foreign exchange earnings. Agriculture directly contributes nearly 30 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), with a further 27 per cent coming from links between agriculture and related manufacturing, distribution and service sectors. However, only 15 per cent of the land area of Kenya is suitable for intensive agriculture, while 65 per cent is classed as being arid or semi-arid land (ASAL), where harsh conditions make extensive pastoralism or dryland farming the only viable agricultural alternatives. In the country's ASALs, livestock husbandry is by far the most important source of livelihood and contributes 10 per cent of the GDP, accounting for slightly more than 30 per cent of the farm gate value of agricultural commodities. As is the case in much of the developing world, the population of Kenya is increasing, especially in rural areas. The associated rising demand for food has led to increased livestock populations in ASALs. At the same time, pockets of more fertile land within ASALs, which pastoralists have traditionally used as grazing areas during periods of drought, are increasingly being settled and used for dryland crop production. Pastoralists and their animals, therefore, are being confined to areas where conditions 76 Information flow: Kenya 77 are drier and ecosystems more fragile. Some disadvantaged groups, including women, are being squeezed off the land onto areas near settlements or markets where they must find alternative sources of livelihood, such as the collection and sale of fuelwood or, even more environmentally damaging, the commercial production of charcoal. In addition, relief food supplies, which have been playing an increasing role in these areas, tend to be grains that require a lot of cooking, and hence fuel. Food relief is also encouraging previously nomadic communities to settle. The net result of these factors is land degradation and poverty, especially around watering places, schools, hospitals and markets. In addition, traditional social structures are disintegrating, particularly indigenous survival and coping mechanisms, as local decision-making processes are taken over by service providers from outside the area. Agricultural research in Kenya has contributed substantially to agricultural development by introducing increased livestock productivity, high-yielding hybrid crops, improved agronomic practices, disease control measures and postharvest technologies. In some cases, selective breeding has developed products, such as Boran cattle, that can be exported. This breed, which has been introduced into drylands in Australia and elsewhere, is resistant to the sleepingsickness-like disease trypanosomiasis. Now Kenya is also self-reliant in vaccines that have been developed and tested against the major livestock diseases. However, the good effects of these achievements have tended to be restricted to research institutions' own fields, and many areas of the country still suffer from declining food production and frequent outbreaks of animal diseases. Farmers, particularly those in ASALs, are becoming poorer and dependence on food relief is increasing. Many of the causes of this situation are related to farmers' and scientists' different perceptions. Scientists have tended to overlook indigenous knowledge of plant species, herbal medicine and bush management, for example, and while rural people are losing many of their traditional skills, they are not receiving sufficient training in how to use new technologies. As a result, development projects have been hampered, veterinary drugs are being misused, drug-resistant pathogens are increasingly common and natural resources are being over-exploited. Other factors with a negative influence on the development of ASALs include poor networking and collaboration among the individuals and organizations involved, donor preferences, low literacy levels, ineffective or inappropriate land-use policies and a lack of or limited infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Mining has been an important activity in Latin America since pre-Hispanic times. Gold, silver and copper were the metals most commonly used by the Indians and the presence of gold was the main reason for the Spanish settlement of the continent. Most early mining was carried out in small-scale operations, but since the early twentieth century, mining has become a largescale, high-tech operation. Arid and semi-arid areas of Latin America are important producers of several mineral commodities. Bolivia, for example, has a wide range of ores, including gold, tin and antimony. Chile is the top producer and exporter of copper. Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Venezuela are rich in deposits of ferronickel and copper. Brazil is one of the world's top mineral producers, particularly of aluminium, gold, iron, manganese, steel and tin. Colombia is a leading producer of nickel and also has large-scale gold and ferronickel mines. Mexico has the world's highest output of silver and is among the top ten producers of arsenic, copper, lead, manganese, molybdenum and zinc. Venezuela is a significant producer of alumina, aluminium, bauxite, gold, iron ore and steel. The Peruvian Andes' rich ore deposits include copper, gold, iron, lead, silver, tin and zinc, and Argentina produces copper, gold, lead and zinc, although mining is still of only secondary importance to the national economy. 82 Metal-tolerant plants: Latin America 83 Although such metals as cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel and zinc are essential for the healthy growth of plants, at high concentrations they can be toxic. Some plants, however, are tolerant to metals and can survive with ease in mineral-rich areas that occur either naturally (e.g., in serpentine soils) or as a result of human interventions (e.g., in the hinterlands of metal smelting or mining activities). Metal-tolerant plants (MTPs) have evolved biological mechanisms that allow them to resist metals in concentrations that would be toxic to many other plants, and in many cases, they are indifferent to the presence of these metals. The metal resistance of these plants has been laboratory tested and found to be particularly effective with cadmium, copper, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium and zinc. Some MTPs—representing about 0.2 per cent of angiosperms (flowering plants)—have the ability to accumulate very high concentrations of certain trace elements that are far in excess of normal physiological requirements and to far greater concentrations than the levels found in most other plant species, including those that are tolerant to soils containing high levels of metal salts. Known as hyper-accumulating plants, they have evolved efficient metal-uptake mechanisms and effective methods for sequestering metals in their tissues. In some cases, the adaptation is so specialized that they cannot complete their life cycles when they are grown on normal soils. MTPs typically have very restricted geographical distributions and they are often endemic to a few small areas of metal-rich soils. Therefore, many species are rare and some are known from only a single site, including some Becium (Lamiaceae) species that are found only on natural copper outcrops in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Others, however, are adapted variants (ecotypes) of common species that grow on metal-rich soils, e.g., those polluted by the metal mining industry, including the grass species Holcus lanatus and the common monkey flower, Mimulus gutattus (Scrophulariaceae). As these examples demonstrate, MTPs occur in many different plant taxa and families. Their metal-specific adaptations and the large range of ecotypes, species and families that they represent give MTPs a special place in biodiversity and genetic resource conservation. The relationship between MTPs and the mining industry is a long one. Metal prospectors looking for areas to mine used the presence of MTPs as an indication that there were valuable metals in the area. Since then, the roles have changed somewhat and MTPs are often used in the restoration and revegetation of former mine sites, where soils have been polluted and degraded. They can also be used in phytoremediation, i.e., the removal of toxic metals from soils (a process known as phytoextraction) or in the bio-mining of low-grade ore that cannot be processed economically by other methods. Furthermore, deposits of metal-rich waste from mining provide new habitats that can be used for the microevolution of metaladapted variants of common species or for colonization by MTPs. In this way, rather than being a liability, abandoned mining sites can be seen as a resource base for unique genetic materials. This is especially so given the wealth of genetic diversity already present in Latin America. Although the five Mediterranean-climate regions of the world cover less than five per cent of the Earth's land mass, they are home to around 20 per cent of the known species of vascular plants. Arid and semi-arid areas of Latin America, in particular, are major centres of plant diversity, and eight of the 25 recognized biodiversity hotspots are located in Latin America, including one in central Chile where over 45 per cent of the region's 3,400 plant species are endemic. Arid and semi-arid areas of Latin America, therefore, are areas where metal-tolerant and hyperaccumulating plants can potentially be found, not only because of the presence of a high number of ore deposits and metal-enriched areas but also thanks to the area's high plant diversity.",

    "abstract": "In arid countries, where most people depend on natural resources for their livelihoods, there are direct links between sustainable development and the support of biodiversity and natural ecosystems. However, while most developing nations focus on economic development and the alleviation of poverty, they often do not actively support the maintenance of biodiversity because they do not recognize or fully understand the importance of the links between biodiversity and sustainable development. This situation has become particularly serious as human populations expand and fragile environments become more and more vulnerable to the potentially devastating effects of increased pressure on declining natural resources. National policy-makers and the managers of arid-zone projects in developing countries are in particular need of a diverse range of skills that are required to tackle a wide variety of challenges to sustainable economic and social development and environmental protection. Arid and semi-arid ecosystems are complex, variable and difficult to understand, particularly because of the speed with which they change. Although national decision-makers understand that the fertility of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems determines their ability to support human livelihoods, they 87 often do not relate the loss of biodiversity to the loss of fertility and function. On the other hand, the scientists working in arid zones (who do focus on biodiversity) tend to concentrate on expert methodologies and peer-reviewed outputs that do not necessarily connect biodiversity to development. In response to this lack of understanding between policy-makers and development project managers, the Desert Research Foundation of Namibia, a nongovernmental organization (NGO), has designed a ten-week training course for graduate students and young professionals. This initiative, the Summer Desertification Programme (SDP), is led by experienced environmentalists backed up by professionals with a long interest in the interface between biophysical environments and socio-economic development.",

    "abstract": "Cape Verde is an archipelago of ten large and eight small islands, located about 450 kilometres from the coast of West Africa. The country has a total surface area of 4,033 square kilometres and a resident population of 380,000. Its climate is dry, with a long dry season from November to June and a short rainy season that runs from July to October. Average annual rainfall ranges from less than 20 millimetres in arid zones to 900 millimetres at high altitudes (some islands have peaks over 1,000 metres high). In terms of both animal and plant wildlife, the country has high biodiversity, and since Cape Verde ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the population and decisionmakers have been sensitized to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Activities to further these ends culminated with the approval of the National Strategy on Biodiversity in February 1999. Cape Verde is also a member of the Comité permanent inter-états de lutte contre la sécheresse dans le sahel (CILSS, or Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel), a Sahelian intergovernmental regional organization charged with helping its member states to coordinate and harmonize their development policies and strategies with respect to food securi 96 Management of biodiversity information: Cape Verde 97 ty and sustainable natural resources management. Biodiversity and its conservation are particularly important to Sahelian countries, where expanding populations and the mismanagement of resources are leading to drought and desertification. In recent years, the issue has received more and more attention, particularly from the Institut du Sahel (INSAH, or the Sahel Institute), a specialized institution of the CILSS. In 1996, CILSS recommended that biodiversity and its conservation be included among the priority actions to be undertaken at the regional level. Many governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), scientific institutions and other stakeholders were then implementing projects to maintain and protect biodiversity, but many of these projects were localized and fragmented. Furthermore, their limited reporting mechanisms meant that many of their interesting and useful findings were not reaching the individuals and institutions that could usefully act on the results. In 1997, INSAH and its scientific partner in the United States, the Council of the Collaborative Research Support Programs (CRSP), working under the umbrella of InterCRSP, conceived a project, the aim of which was to optimize the management of biodiversity information in the Sahel. As part of this overall project, Cape Verde embarked on a study of biodiversity activities within its national boundaries. It is hoped that the project will ultimately provide the stimulus to establish and promote government and private biodiversity conservation activities throughout Cape Verde and the Sahel region.",

    "abstract": "The plains of Uzbekistan lie in the basins of the two largest rivers in Central Asia, the Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya. The region is classed as arid and semi-arid, with what little rain that does fall coming mainly in winter and spring. Although the local grey soils are fertile, the seasonal lack of water means that they are difficult to farm. Despite this, the growing population is developing larger and larger areas of these potentially productive soils for irrigated farming, particularly for cotton and grain crops. However, merely irrigating the crops is not enough to make such farming sustainable. Among the problems faced by Uzbekistan's farmers are strong winds that carry away much of the topsoil (the most fertile layer) after fields have been irrigated and ploughed. In addition, periods of continual cultivation are exhausting the land and leading to further soil degradation. The intensive cropping practices are causing a loss of the region's biodiversity as many of the area's wild species are becoming locally extinct. Inappropriate farming techniques, especially the misuse of artificial fertilizers, are also spoiling the soil's natural balance and encouraging infestations of pests and diseases. There is a need, therefore, to find ways of stabilizing agricultural soils so that they can be as productive as possible 103 without damaging the environment. On the Uzbekistan plains, one of the most effective ways of doing this has been to establish protective forest stands (PFSs)—artificial landscape features that complement and protect natural ones.

    "abstract": "Rainfall in Jordan varies between 50 millimetres a year in the arid Badia region to 600 millimetres in the northwestern highlands. Such limited rainfall over a country of just 89,000 square kilometres has meant that, since the 1960s, Jordan has suffered from severe water shortages. A growing demand continues to outstrip the supply, resulting in serious shortfalls for both domestic and agricultural uses. This limits the country's agricultural development, especially in rain-fed areas. The situation has been exacerbated by additional factors, including the excessive extraction of groundwater, which leads to depleted reserves and deteriorating water quality. Currently, 51 per cent of the 920 million cubic metres of water used every year comes from surface water, 29 per cent from renewable groundwater, 14 per cent from non-renewable groundwater and 6 per cent from treated wastewater. Jordan's population growth of 3.4 per cent per annum has forced agriculture to encroach over a larger area of land. However, this has caused environmental problems and there are signs of desertification in several regions. Agricultural development is at risk because of unsustainable practices, accelerated soil erosion, soil degradation and a general decrease in land productivity. The result is decreasing 107 self-sufficiency for most food commodities, so there is a desperate need to focus on the conservation, efficient use and effective management of the available land and water resources. One such management technique, water harvesting, involves the smallscale collection of rainfall and run-off water. Water harvesting increases the efficiency of water use and can lead to increased crop production and decreased soil erosion. Harvested water can be used to develop arid and semi-arid lands, improve biodiversity by supporting wild plant species, increase the grazing capacity of pastureland, alleviate the pressure on existing water supplies and recharge groundwater supplies. Water harvesting is most successful when water catchment areas have a high run-off coefficient for water collection, and run-on areas, where crops are grown, have soils with a high enough water retention capacity to supply crops with their water needs from one period of rainfall to the next. The system is based on the probability of seasonal rains providing enough run-off to meet crops' water requirements and to make water harvesting function at the optimum level. Rainfall that meets this requirement is known as the \"design rainfall\". Too high or too low a probability of achieving design rainfall is associated with the risk of flooding the system or crop failure, respectively. The practice of harvesting water in Jordan dates back more than 4,000 years and archaeological remains of pools, cisterns, dams and channels have been found at several sites. Some of these ancient systems are still functional, such as some Roman pools near Ajloun, Madaba and Mwaggar. In winter, water was channelled and pumped to the city, where it was stored in cisterns and reservoirs excavated in the rock for domestic use during dry seasons. Rainfed agriculture was also supported by harvested water. The features of traditional Jordanian water-harvesting systems varied depending on the local climate, topography and soil type as well as on the use to which the water was to be put. In arid areas, deep pools were used to supply human and animal drinking water; in marginal areas, large pools were used for crop irrigation and animal watering; in mountainous areas, reservoirs were carved out of the rock; and in almost all rural areas, cisterns were used to store drinking water. The practice of water harvesting reached its peak during the Islamic era (from the seventh to twelfth centuries), when water management and the regulation of floodwater were introduced and rights to water were issued. Modern water-harvesting techniques have particular potential in two regions of Jordan: the highlands and the steppe. In the highlands, rainfall ranges from 200 to 550 millimetres a year, with most falling between November and March. Only 9 per cent of the highland area is suitable for rain-fed agriculture and small farms prevail in the rain Water harvesting: Jordan 109 fed areas. This reduces the feasibility of introducing new technologies and results in low land productivity. In the steppe region, which covers 13 per cent of Jordan, much of the annual 100 to 250 millimetres of rain falls in strong, sporadic storms. The fine soils in this area have a high silt content and are very vulnerable to erosion by wind and water, especially during storms, and to degradation, reducing the potential for agricultural development. Improving agricultural practices in the steppe depends on water harvesting and there have been five recent government projects relating to water harvesting in this area of Jordan.",

    "abstract": "Mexico has a land area of about 2 million square kilometres and a population of about 97 million. More than 23 million people (24 per cent of the population) depend on agriculture, earning a living mainly from small farms of less than 5 hectares each. About 82 per cent of the country's 31 million hectares of cropland are rain-fed, while the rest is irrigated. However, about half of this cropland lies on the central plateau, which has only 12 per cent of Mexico's water resources. In addition, 60 per cent of the population live on this plateau. Most water for irrigation comes from dams, lakes, deep wells and depressions for catching run-off rainfall. Farmers in rain-fed regions have also developed ways of harvesting rainwater and practise terracing, contour tillage and strip tillage. However, these techniques are inconvenient because they make it difficult to use farm machinery, they are costly and they require a lot of maintenance. Furthermore, rainfall in the arid or semi-arid zones of Mexico is often poorly distributed, with much of the year's total arriving all at once in intense, heavy storms. As a result, these regions are vulnerable to drought, soil degradation and soil erosion caused by the run-off from heavy rain. In some areas, 113 excess water during years of unusually high rainfall also conspires to reduce crop yields. The low value of the crops that can be grown in these zones exacerbates this problem because farmers cannot afford to introduce expensive soil and water conservation measures. This is causing a downward spiral of soil degradation, lost crop productivity and less profitable agriculture, which, in turn, is likely to result in farmers abandoning the land to find alternative work in the cities, where they often end up among the growing populations of the slum areas. An estimated 400,000 people a year are believed to be emigrating from rural areas throughout Mexico. In response to these challenges, a technique known as furrow dyking has been developed. Furrow dyking involves forming moulds of soil, or dams, along furrows, creating a multitude of long, narrow basins, or micro-catchment areas, between furrows. Rainfall is trapped in these basins and gradually soaks into the soil where it becomes available to the crop throughout the growing season. One of the advantages of this technique is that there is no run-off, thus preventing soil erosion. The simplest way of creating the basins for furrow dyking is to build small earth dams at regular intervals between the furrows. Specially designed mechanical dyking equipment is usually used to do this, but it can also be done manually with hand hoes or shovels. Although the first recorded instance of mechanical furrow dyking was during the 1930s in the United States, the practice is probably far older and may date back to early agrarian times. In Mexico, both mechanized and small-scale farmers are now using furrow dyking to maintain or increase their crop yields in both irrigated and rain-fed areas. However, furrow dyking is costly and requires substantial inputs of labour.",

    "abstract": "Developing countries such as Mexico need to boost the economic status of resource-poor farmers. One of the best ways of doing this is to adopt new technologies that increase crop production through the optimal use of such scarce resources as land, water and fertilizers. Mexico also has a critical need to increase its food production in order to satisfy the demands of a growing population. However, 52 per cent of the national territory is unsuitable for agriculture because of its harsh climate with low rainfall and hard frosts and its shallow soils, which rapidly lose their fertility when cultivated. Whereas a small proportion of the land is suitable for intensive agriculture, most of the rest suffers from a lack of surface water sources and can support only subsistence-level dryland farming. As a result, poor farmers who cannot afford to introduce new technologies and practices miss out on the production improvements that such innovations make possible. Until now, the increased use of fertilizers has been the main way of boosting dryland farm production, but poor farmers are reluctant to spend scarce funds on inputs for crops that may, in any case, be lost to adverse conditions. Above all, Mexico needs to increase its maize production in order to become self-sufficient in this important crop, which provides both human food and animal fodder. A growing population 118 Soil-less agriculture: Mexico  119 is forcing the country to import increasing quantities from international markets, where price fluctuations put added pressure on the national economy. Although Mexico has the potential to be self-sufficient in maize, a number of factors combine to make commercial maize cultivation in arid and semi-arid zones an unattractive proposition. The most significant of these are: increasing production costs; a price-fixing policy for food products; under- or non-existent use of yieldincreasing technologies; low yields per hectare; dryland farmers' lack of access to credit; shortages of agricultural inputs; and farmers' underuse of the resources and economic support that would make sustainable agriculture possible. As a result, dryland farmers turn to non-agricultural activities, such as hunting and gathering or extensive pastoralism, or they migrate to find work elsewhere. Mexico does have a comparatively small land area under irrigated agriculture, using mainly storage wells, deep wells, and surface rivers and streams. However, these systems often involve significant water, energy and agricultural input costs, and their use does not always increase production. The remaining agricultural areas are irrigated by shallow wells of less than 20 metres in depth. These collect water from temporary water sources and traditionally have been used to produce vegetables for home consumption and limited marketing. An increased population in many of these areas is putting additional pressure on land and water resources and reducing their availability for agriculture, thereby further reducing Mexico's food production capabilities. In response to these problems, scientists at the Postgraduate College of the San Luis Potosí Regional Centre for the Study of Arid and Semi-Arid Zones have begun to investigate the potential for intense hydroponic production systems to grow vegetables, forage, fruit and forest plants in Mexico's arid and semi-arid areas.",

    "abstract": "The environment of much of Chile is arid and fragile. Although the country is rich in such valuable minerals as copper, silver, gold, iron and nitrates, they have often been exploited to exhaustion, leaving behind degraded environments and abandoned towns and cities. Marine fisheries have also been over-exploited, leading to the abandonment of coastal settlements. Along with the environmental degradation, people who have lost their source of livelihood are forced to move away, often ending up in the suburbs and slums of large cities where the quality of life is low. One solution to this problem is to promote sustainable rural development that is not dependent on any one resource. However, the country's chronic shortage of water makes this very difficult. To counter this situation, scientists in Chile and several other developing countries are experimenting with an oftenoverlooked but significant source of water in dry areas:  fog. Fog is made up of very small droplets of water that are too light to fall but that gather on the surfaces of plants, rocks and soil. In nature, the presence of fog makes it possible for plants to survive in so-called fog oases, that is, areas with only a few 123 millimetres of rain a year. The water harvested when special fog collectors are used to extract fog from the atmosphere can be enough to supply the domestic needs of towns with more than 500 inhabitants, provide irrigation for agriculture and forestry, and help to regenerate deteriorated ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The term “biodiversity conservation” first emerged in the 1980s and became more widely used after the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, which generated two international environmental agreements: the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). CBD is financed through the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and, for the past decade, international agencies have been trying to support the implementation of CDB in developing countries. However, progress has been slow, success has been qualified and project sustainability has been a recurrent issue. A recent review in South Africa, for example, shows that biodiversity has declined over the past 10 years even despite a decrease in cultivation and grazing and an expansion of protected areas. This poor performance has triggered the crucial question: how can biodiversity conservation be made sustainable? Before this question can be answered, it is necessary to identify the value of biodiversity, the best ways of conserving biodiversity, the individuals and institutions involved in conservation projects, and the ways in which the benefits of such projects are (or could be) shared. 13 It is generally agreed that biodiversity is of significant social, aesthetic, cultural and economic value to human societies. In economic analyses, these goods and services are generally divided into use and non-use values. Use values are subdivided into direct and indirect values. Direct values take into account the physical goods that people can use (such as food, fuel, timber and herbal medicines) and the aesthetic or recreational benefits that can be obtained. Indirect use values are the ecological functions that maintain the stability and productivity of the local and global environments. Although this valuing system is comprehensive, it offers very little room for manoeuvre in decision-making, as it is extremely difficult to measure and categorize the different values of biodiversity. In general, direct use values are most important at the local level, while indirect use values become decisive at the regional level. At the global level, concerns over the non-use values predominate. This diversity of values is not necessarily negative, as it represents what each of the stakeholders involved may stand to gain from biodiversity conservation. The proviso is, of course, that access to these values must be evenly distributed among all stakeholders. In its early days, biodiversity conservation was seen as being driven mainly by international organizations and other (usually developed-country) agents from outside the areas concerned. This view is being revised and people now realize that many local populations in vulnerable environments have devised their own efficient natural-resource management systems. One example is the Hema system that is applied to manage the Bedouins’ communal rangelands in Lebanon. By protecting large areas of steppe, it prevents overgrazing and allows the increase of floral populations and diversity. Early conservation activities, including game reserves, tended to follow the “fortress” approach of keeping local people away from protected areas without any concern for the traditional dependence of rural populations on natural resources. The approach to biodiversity management now emerging asserts that there can be no environmental conservation without social, economic and political development. Biodiversity conservation experts have been trying to address the social needs of the people who live near reserve areas. Ways of achieving this include: • identifying and developing alternative resources to replace the existing livelihood strategies of local populations; • providing compensation for the extra costs incurred by conservation activities; and • deriving benefits from conservation as a motor for development. This can be achieved, for example, by generating revenue from tourism or by adapting existing management strategies in ways that are compatible with the conservation of valuable resources, e.g., through the adoption of Biodiversity conservation priorities: Lebanon 15 improved industrial practices or the enhancement of local livelihoods. Biodiversity conservation needs to be viewed as a team challenge in which the various players agree on a unified agenda and then work together to attain a collective goal. During this process, the participants must show mutual support, trust and understanding of their own and one another’s different roles as links in a chain, the weakest link of which could cause the whole system to crash. Among the main players in biodiversity conservation are: • the developed North (governments, institutions and multinational corporations); • international development agencies and donor organizations; • the governments of the South; • academics and their institutions; • local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and other civil-society organizations; and • local communities. Each of these players requires something different from biodiversity conservation. The agents from the developed North are focused primarily on the nonuse value of biodiversity conservation as a way of protecting the planet’s ecosystem and their own privileged position. Development-agency and donor-organization agendas closely mirror those of the developed North, but most of these entities also have great confidence in local development, placing them in the unenviable situation of using local actors to implement a global agenda. Southern governments are often overwhelmed by short-term micro-economic realities and suffer from the effects of underfunded institutions, a lack of political will and poor regulatory frameworks, making them unable to commit to global or local biodiversity programmes. Academics are concerned with both local and global aspects of biodiversity, but they are often out of touch with grass-roots realities. Local NGOs have learned to become malleable in order to accommodate the agendas of the donors that fund them, but these resources have often stayed with elite networks that are reluctant to share them with the poor. Finally, farmers, rural people and local communities are at the receiving end of all biodiversity conservation efforts, their driving force is survival and their continued existence hinges on the sustainable use of natural resources—as they have always known. In fact, local people are the real stewards of bio-resources and are the best-placed players in the conservation challenge. However, biodiversity conservation efforts have rarely included them as team members or have done so in ways that have generally been to their detriment. Local people’s livelihoods have been threatened, and in many cases destroyed, by well-meaning conservation plans. Examples abound of nature reserves and protected areas established on land that was inhabited and used by indigenous people, resulting in resettle ment, displacement and restricted access to resources. Recent projects have made timid attempts to identify alternative livelihoods for local communities, but such alternatives are few and far between in rural areas. Even where such options as ecotourism and associated activities have been implemented, many of the benefits have gone to outsiders rather than to the local community. In the Middle East, and in Lebanon in particular, one of the main obstacles to the full participation of local people is the fact that rural societies can be excessively stratified. In order to get round this challenge, projects often rely on local NGOs, which are presumed to represent the local people and to work for the public good. However, this approach is often flawed because local NGOs serve, at best, only as entry points, and more than one entry point is needed in a complex society. In the absence of multiple entry points, projects quickly become hostage to the good will of one local group and reflect this group’s priorities rather than the priorities of the whole community. It therefore appears that the current framework of action for biodiversity conservation provides something for all players except for those local communities whose survival and livelihood depend on the use of natural resources. A new approach, based on converging environmental and development goals, must be adopted to guarantee that the basic needs of rural people are satisfied. The sustainable rural livelihoods (SRL) framework, popularized in the late 1990s, provides a good, integrative framework that can be built on and adapted for achieving more harmony among all stakeholders. A generally accepted definition of SRL is: “A livelihood comprises the capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities required for a means of living. A livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks and maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets, both now and in the future, while not undermining the natural resource base.” (Diana Carney, ed., Sustainable rural livelihoods: what contributions can we make? United Kingdom, Department for International Development (DFID), 1998, 213 pp.). While the SRL approach starts with people, it does not neglect the environment. Indeed, one of the strengths of the livelihood approach is that it includes the environment within a holistic framework. At its heart lies an analysis of the five different types of capital assets on which individuals draw to build their livelihoods: natural capital, human capital, financial capital, physical capital and social capital. The approach also includes an analysis of the vulnerability context in which assets exist (the trends, shocks and local cultural practices that affect livelihoods) and aims to develop an understanding of the structures and organizations—both governmental and private—and processes (policies, laws and incentives) that define people’s livelihood options. The livelihood approach, therefore, is a more long-term commitment to target groups and areas. Biodiversity conservation priorities: Lebanon 17 Biodiversity is part of the natural capital from which people derive livelihoods. Thus, in the SRL context, biodiversity is seen as a means of contributing to sustainable livelihoods rather than as an end in itself. Effective biodiversity conservation can be achieved only by maximizing the social and economic benefits that arise out of the protection or sustainable use of biodiversity. By seeking the fair and equitable distribution of those benefits, SRL proposes a set of strategic options that support the contribution of biodiversity conservation to poverty reduction. These involve trade-offs between total protection and total exploitation and are viable only when the link between maintaining biodiversity and supporting local livelihoods can be demonstrated. One example is the establishment of protected spots within a productive landscape, which serve to protect the habitat of local breeding stocks, for example.",

    "abstract": "The Laboratory of Photovoltaic Research (LPR) was established at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) in 1979. Within a few years, the laboratory had established itself as a pioneer in solar power research and development, both within Brazil and throughout Latin America. While LPR focused its research on developing several new technologies for solar cells, modules and semi-conductors, it was also training young Brazilian and Latin American scientists in laboratory work and offering graduate and postgraduate courses in solar energy conversion, materials science and electronic device physics. The main outputs of the laboratory are: • highly trained Brazilian and Latin American scientists; • significant contributions to state-of-the-art photovoltaic (PV) materials and devices; and • increased understanding of the socio-economic aspects relating to the use of solar energy in developing countries. In its first two decades of operation, LPR has awarded 50 M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees. It has also generated a great deal of important research work: a total of 300 papers and technical communications on solar energy, PV conversion, materials science and device physics has been published in journals and/or presented at international conferences. Other works on the socio-economic aspects of solar energy have been equally successful on the international stage. ◆ Costs Total funding of about US$5 million. Most funds from Brazilian funding agencies: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) and Fundação Coordinação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES). Private sector: US$1 million, mainly from Fundação CESP, Brazil. International sources: US$100,000: European Union (EU), Organization of American States (OAS) and Programa Iberoamericano de Ciencia y Tecnología para el Desarrollo (CYTED). LPR is regarded as one of the top institutions of the developing world in terms of capacity-building and scientific output, and it has a prestigious international standing among the scientific community in both developed and developing countries. Its staff members have received national and international awards and have served on the committees of most international conferences on solar energy conversion in Asia, Europe, Latin America and the United States. LPR staff members are also on the editorial boards of important specialist journals, such as Solar and Wind Energy, Renewable Energy, Solar Energy Materials and The Brazilian Journal of Physics. International partnerships are important to the work of LPR, which has collaborated with other laboratories in Argentina, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and the United States. Among its achievements are promoting the study of solar energy conversion in the Latin American region (having trained students from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela) and helping to develop national awareness of the value of renewable energy for sustainable development (which is now included as an essential element of government energy planning).",

Most of the people without power live in remote areas of western China where population density is low and the inhabitants are often nomadic. The climate is dry with intense solar radiation. Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, therefore, is a good potential source of electricity. To encourage the development of renewable energy applications, the local government has introduced incentives, including subsidies, tax breaks and access to credit. These policies have promoted the use of PV power and, over the last 10 years, the PV market has increased at an average of 20 per cent per year. From near zero in 1981, more than 3,500 kilowatts of solar power were being generated by nearly 25,000 PV systems throughout China by 2001. As part of this initiative, between 1993 and 1999, seven PV power stations were constructed in Tibet, the area with the highest incidence of solar radiation in the country. The 100-kilowatt PV power station in Anduo county is the largest of these seven power stations. It offers an excellent example of how PV electricity can help to solve the power problems of China and how such electricity can be generated even in apparently hostile environmental conditions.",

The latter, Dr. S. S. Nandwani, was invited to go to Costa Rica to work on solar energy, and he arrived at National University in Heredia in 1978. There he found practically no facilities or equipment for conducting useful research into solar energy, and there did not seem to be any funding either. An initial request for US$3,500 to buy materials and some basic equipment was turned down because the university could not afford it. Since then, however, Costa Rica has produced some very useful solar energy research, thanks in part to Nandwani's efforts. Not only has he written numerous articles for national and international publications, but he has also developed a name for himself as an avid public speaker and a stalwart attendee of conferences on solar energy. National University now has a model solar house in which to carry out research and demonstrations, with solar panels and photovoltaic (PV) devices worth US$60,000 donated by the Government of India. The university continues to lack funds for this work (having officially provided only about US$150 a year to the solar energy research laboratory); however, international support has come from ICTP, India, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and elsewhere.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the profitability of the Indian silk-reeling industry has been reduced by the import of cheaper raw silk and the high prices of cocoons. In addition, the productivity of the sector is low because there have been no systematic attempts to upgrade its technology, conserve energy or recover by-products. Even so, after China, India is the world’s second largest producer of silk — the queen of textiles — producing about 14,000 metric tons a year. Most of this silk is reeled in the 35,000 charkha ovens and the 26,000 cottage basin ovens that are currently registered. Annual fuel consumption of cottage basin ovens is estimated at 120,000 tons of fuelwood, while charkhas consume 105,000 tons of locally available biomass, such as groundnut shells, tamarind and rice husks and coffee beans. However, the consumption of these fuels by the silk industry is only 11.7 to 15.3 per cent efficient. To tackle the problem of inefficient energy consumption, the New Delhibased Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) considered a two-way strategy that involved: (a) retrofitting existing ovens to improve their efficiency, and (b) introducing gasification technology. Efforts focused on developing gasifierbased cottage basins that could be commercialized. The main steps in the project were a preliminary energy audit, a survey of the silk sector, a more detailed energy audit, development and field-testing of laboratory prototypes, and development and demonstration of a commercial prototype. As a result, a cocoon cooking oven whose main component is a gasifier is now being marketed under the name of SERI-2000. During field-testing, it was discovered that fuel savings were not the only benefit of gasifier-based systems. The new ovens also led to: • improved silk productivity (in terms of both quality and quantity), probably as a result of the ovens’ controlled processing parameters such as water level and temperature; • reduced pollution; • time, labour and water savings; and • increased profit margins for users as a result of all of the above. The main lesson learned from the project was that the success of the new technology depended on inputs from stakeholders, including oven users, silk experts, engineering consultants and manufacturers.",

    "abstract": "In India, a combination of vast, untapped renewable energy resources and growing demands on the already stretched existing electricity supply system led to calls to integrate renewable energy into national energy planning and provision. This need to create a balanced mix between conventional and renewable energy meant that renewable energy technologies had to be taken beyond their research, development and demonstration stage so that they could be commercialized through appropriate financing mechanisms. In 1987, the Ministry of Nonconventional Energy Sources (MNES) set up the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited (IREDA) to meet this need. In addition, MNES adopted several field-level programmes to demonstrate the use of photovoltaic (PV) technology and to research new technologies and local and national production capabilities. The most common systems used by these programmes are portable solar lanterns, fixed-type solar home systems, street lighting systems and small-capacity village-level power plants. To promote the schemes in individual Indian States, State field offices have been established and directmarketing solar shops have been set up in several cities.",

    "abstract": "India is an agrarian country that has achieved good levels of agricultural production. The challenge it now faces is to find ways of improving post-harvest processing to boost the quality and shelf life of its agricultural products. Traditionally, sun-drying in the open air was the main way of processing crops after harvest, and this is still practised by small-scale producers. More recently, however, conventional fossil fuels have replaced the sun as a source of energy for the drying of crops and produce, particularly among industrial-scale producers. Both methods have drawbacks: either they are not particularly hygienic or healthy or they consume energy inefficiently and uneconomically, causing environmental pollution, which, among its other negative effects, reduces the quality of the final products. Solar thermal energy has the potential to replace fossil fuels in both industry and agriculture and represents a cleaner alternative that is more economical, more environmentally friendly and sustainable and that produces higherquality end-products. With this goal in view, a group of Indian planters and energy scientists came together to create an interactive forum called the Planters Energy Network (PEN). One of the first objectives of PEN was to improve solar air heating technology for industrial and agricultural uses. It did this by developing the solar hot air roof (SHARO), which is based on a simple device that is economical to install because it uses existing rooftops as solar collectors. SHAROs use two main types of system: the partial energy delivery (PED) system for tea processing and the full energy delivery (FED) system for processing spices and fish and preserving vegetables. In all of these industries, the use of SHAROs has reduced energy consumption and expenditure to such an extent that the initial costs of installing the system can be recuperated within two to three years. Nine tea factories are saving a total of US$17,500 a year in fuel costs, while the potential exists to cut fuel consumption for the processing of spices, fruit and coffee by between 70 and 90 per cent. Vegetable-drying units and tanneries are also consuming far less non-renewable energy. Overall, the use of SHAROs is cutting the fuel bills of these industries by almost US$44,000 per year and reducing environment-damaging emissions of carbon dioxide by almost 21,990 tonnes, thereby helping to arrest the deforestation that threatens the entire world, particularly developing countries.",

It enjoys 3,500 hours of sun a year and an average daily irradiation of 22 megajoules per square metre. In 1993, a project to use some of this solar power to heat the water for a new public bath complex was designed and initiated. The solar bath project, which took four months to complete, broke new ground in two ways. It was the first time that public baths were built and opened in the area, and the project uses what is thus far the largest solar power system in the country. The system consists of two collector fields, each containing four rows of ten collectors. The collectors are connected to a hot-header pipe that feeds a 3,000litre storage tank by pumps circulating water through a U-tube heat exchanger. The water returns to the collectors via a cold-header pipe. Two 3,000-litre tanks are connected in series and hot water is stored in a 6,000-litre main tank that supplies hot water for 12 showers. The bath complex can serve up to 400 people a day.",

    "abstract": "In 1980, the Government of Nigeria established the National Centre for Energy Research and Development (NCERD) at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, in the eastern part of the country. The NCERD mandate is to carry out research and development on solar and other renewable energy technologies and to disseminate the results. Activities of the Centre include the training of personnel (engineers, scientists, technicians, artisans, etc.) in a wide range of technologies. More specifically, NCERD conducts research and systems development in photovoltaic (PV) solar energy, solar thermal energy (for drying, heating and cooking, and poultry production), biomass and biogas, coal briquette technologies and systems for using energy efficiently. The present case study focuses on an NCERD project to use solar energy to make poultry brooding systems in Nigeria more efficient and profitable. Farmers often lose a sizable proportion of their day-old chicks during the brooding period as a result of inadequate or non-existent power supplies. The project pioneered research on the socio-economic impact of using solar energy in poultry brooding technology in rural areas. The special features of the innovative poultry brooding technology of the project are that it harnesses solar energy and uses locally available materials; it can be adapted to both rural and urban poultry production; and it incorporates a waste conveyor, which aids the removal of poultry waste. Use of this technology has led to: • a pollution-free environment for poultry breeding; • chicks of improved feed conversion ratios and lower mortality rates; • systems that are free from fire hazards and allow higher profit margins than conventional brooders; • development of small and medium-sized poultry brooding systems. The case study shows how solar energy can help to solve the problem of heating for the poultry industry. Project findings also could prove useful in devising policies to reduce the risk of power failure or unavailability of power for poultry farmers. This experience involved design, development and technology transfer while its major objective (and challenge) was to popularize and disseminate a new technology.",

    "abstract": "In the developing world, the availability and cost of power can play a vital role in economic development and people's well-being. As countries become wealthier and their populations grow, demand for energy increases. Traditional sources of energy are often too expensive to satisfy this demand. There are also concerns about the limited reserves of fossil fuels and their environmental costs. Solar energy, in particular, is an excellent alternative to fossil fuels, particularly for such developing countries as Pakistan that receive high levels of solar radiation. More and more countries, therefore, are introducing economically and environmentally sound energy policies and are turning to solar energy for a wide range of uses, including cooking and water heating. However, people are unlikely to adopt a completely new technology until they know something about it and have seen how it works. They need to have access to clearly presented information that explains the technical and economic benefits of replacing long-established traditional methods with new, innovative ways of doing things. This means that the new technology must be readily available. When this project began, the Solar Energy Research Centre (SERC) in Pakistan had already developed designs for solar geysers and cookers suited to the country’s socio-economic conditions. However, the Centre did not have facilities to manufacture these devices at affordable prices and of high enough quality. With US$2,500 in funding, SERC was able to establish an up-to-date facility for the mass production of solar geysers and cookers and provide all the necessary technical support, service implementation and management for such a facility.",

    "abstract": "In the mountainous regions of southern and western Saudi Arabia, there are many road tunnels, which need to be lit during daylight hours to avoid accidents when drivers are suddenly plunged from bright sunlight into darkness. Since 1985, photovoltaic (PV) power systems have provided daytime lighting for two of these tunnels:  tunnel 1, which is 166 metres long, and tunnel 2, which is 546 metres long. The success of this initiative led the Ministry of Communication to recommend that daytime lighting be provided to all tunnels over 100 metres in length. However, the local electricity power company found that it was unable to connect 13 of these tunnels because they are located in difficult mountainous terrain beyond the reach of the local electricity grid. The total length of these tunnels is 3,548 metres, varying from 115 to 687 metres per tunnel. The aim of the project was to use PV systems to light the 13 problem tunnels. First, the tunnels had to be assessed to make sure that they were appropriate sites for the installation and operation of PV lighting systems. Then a suitable PV system had to be designed, which included selecting the best position and equipment to use, simulating the performance of the system, studying its life-cycle and ensuring that its battery would have sufficient capacity to allow the PV system to run autonomously during periods of continuous cloud cover. The costs of installing, operating and maintaining PV systems were estimated to be higher than for diesel systems, so it was decided that a hybrid PV system would be the best option. One reason for not choosing the diesel system alone is the worldwide need to find alternatives to fossil fuels, reserves of which are declining as the world population increases. Solar power is such an alternative. Figure 1 PV system for tunnel no. 9",

    "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) energy has become a technologically reliable alternative to conventional sources of electricity. It can be used for many different applications, and its generation has proved to be financially and economically profitable. However, in rural Senegal, the economically viable use of PV electricity faces two main constraints:  systems are expensive to install, and it is difficult to operate and maintain those systems once they have been installed. Various schemes have been devised to encourage people to use photovoltaics, including government-funded systems that are provided without charge to users, government-subsidized systems, and systems driven by credit and cash sales. The success of these schemes, however, has been hampered by a lack of management systems that can coordinate equipment, operating and maintenance costs with the income of electricity users. To help overcome this problem and to promote the use of solar energy in rural areas of Senegal, the Governments of Japan and Senegal initiated a project that experiments with charging fees for providing rural communities with electricity from decentralized PV systems. The scheme is based on the concept of selling an energy supply service. Users pay a monthly rental fee, which is calculated according to their incomes and the costs of providing, installing, operating and maintaining the system. A private operator, MATFORCE, manages the decentralized PV systems. The project has demonstrated that such a management model for supplying PV power is particularly appropriate to rural areas in developing countries, especially in Africa. It is an innovative way of guaranteeing sustainable rural electrification by providing high-quality service that makes solar electricity available, accessible and affordable for rural areas and for which users are willing to pay.",

    "abstract": "In mountainous areas where there are plenty of rivers and streams, the power of flowing water can be harnessed and used to generate electricity. Such hydropower can be particularly beneficial in remote areas in many developing countries, where electricity from other sources is not available. Even very small hydroelectric systems consisting of a propeller turbine, a generator, wires and switches can be placed in mountain streams or rivers and used to generate affordable electricity for individual households. Such very small-scale — or micro- — hydroelectric systems can supply power to remote, mountain communities far more cheaply and reliably than either diesel generators or high-voltage grids and are common throughout the Asia and the Pacific region. Other small-scale options involve local-level mini-grids that use hydropower either on their own or together with power generated from other sources. In addition to using hydroelectricity in their homes, people living in remote, rural communities can use it to fuel a wide range of small-scale agricultural and industrial activities, from which they can derive income. Over the last few years, people in developing countries have become more aware of just how useful small-scale hydroelectric power systems can be to rural development in their countries, particularly in mountainous areas. The technology for generating micro-hydroelectric energy is not new, but the challenge now is how best to use this technology to supply power at very low annual running costs and in ways that prolong the life of electricity-generating machinery. To this end, under the Renewable Energy Action Plan (REAP) of the Government of Viet Nam, scientists at the Institute of Materials Science (IMS) of the National Centre for Natural Sciences and Technology (NCST) have developed improved versions of microhydroelectricity generators. The success of these generators is demonstrated by their popularity in rural areas and the fact that they are now commercially available in at least six other countries.",

    "abstract": "The Mhondoro solar photovoltaic (PV) battery charging station is the first of its kind in Zimbabwe. The Mhondoro project, which was implemented by the Energy Technology Institute (ETI) of the Scientific and Industrial Research and Development Centre (SIRDC), is based on the simple concept of reducing the initial costs of small-scale solar systems for home use. These costs have been significant, especially for those who stand to benefit most from solar-generated power. A solar home lighting system (SHS) consists of four main components: a solar panel, a battery, a charge controller, and solar lights. The solar panel accounts for about 50 per cent of the cost of the SHS and, at about Z$100,000 for a 50-watt panel, is beyond the reach of most people in rural areas. A solar battery charging station sidesteps this problem by using only a few centrally located solar panels to charge a larger number of batteries for home lighting. The individual SHS user does not have to pay for the solar panel, cutting the initial cost of an SHS by nearly 50 per cent. Users of the scheme pay a fee, which entitles them to have their batteries recharged at the central station. The money raised from fees is used to run and maintain the station. In the Mhondoro project, a 1-kilowatt central battery charging station with 12 solar panels of 83 watts each was installed at a medical clinic that serves 23 villages located some 100 kilometres southwest of Harare. Project participants paid for a battery, a charge controller, solar lights and wiring for their own household systems. The charging station provides power for the clinic and for batteries used by up to 50 households, including those participating in the project and other local people who pay a small fee to charge batteries at the station. Participation has been the watchword since the outset of the project. The project organizers realized that by involving people from the local community, they would feel that the project was really theirs, thereby ensuring its sustainability. First, the Department of Energy (DOE) in the Ministry of Mines and Energy helped ETI to select Mhondoro as the project site. Then meetings were held to introduce the project to local people, gauge their responses and discuss their expectations. During implementation, local labourers and artisans worked to design and build the station. This made it a community-owned asset and not something mysterious and threatening that had been introduced by outsiders. Local people are also responsible for the day-to-day running of the station, security and fee collection. Participants’ willingness to pay for solar lighting in their homes is a significant departure from the long-established mindset of projects of this kind as being wholly donor-funded and donor-driven. In fact, the project has disproved the popular notion that rural communities are merely Recharging batteries: Zimbabwe 109 the passive recipients of donor assistance by demonstrating how people are willing to pay for what they need if they are well informed, involved and able to make their own decisions about what is best for them.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem worldwide but its therapeutic management still suffers from major limitations. Plants have been used for the treatment of diabetes for centuries. As a result, their scientific evaluation has been an important responsibility of scientists and also a logical way of searching for new antidiabetic drugs. The World Health Organization (WHO) is now emphasizing the importance of solving the diabetes problem. A systematic study of plant materials used for treating diabetic patients has been undertaken by the Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (BIRDEM). BIRDEM has collaborated with the Department of Chemistry at Dhaka University and other institutions abroad to attack this disease through herbal solutions. Laboratory trials on diabetic model rats were designed to explore the possible hypoglycemic (abnormally low concentration of sugar in the blood) and antihyperglycemic (prevention of the abnormally high concentration of sugar in the blood) activity of the plant materials. The trials also focused on the possible target tissues involved in the action. This background knowledge was then used to conduct human trials with the identified active principle or one of its upstream products that was found to be therapeutically acceptable as well as economically feasible in the context of the society in which it would be used. In these trials, the plant commonly known as fenugreek (Trigonella foenumgraecum), which is native to southeast Europe and west Asia, was scientifically tested for its well-known ability in traditional medicine to act as a substitute for insulin among diabetic patients. Through extensive investigation on several plants from south and south east Asia for their hypoglycemic and antihyperglycemic effects, fenugreek was shown to be a successful herbal solution to diabetes mellitus. Using the diabetic model rats, fenugreek was found to have a partially mediated activity due to a soluble dietary fiber (galactonmannan) present in the plant. Analysis of the data indicated the possibility of delayed glucose absorption in the gut. This finding was useful given that such an effect is one of the major approaches for antidiabetic drug development. Additional results showed that the water extract of fenugreek can effectively reduce the rise in plasma glucose during digestion without any elevation in serum insulin levels. Preliminary findings indicate that the antihyperglycemic effect of the fenugreek water extract might be related to the inhibition of disaccharidase activity in the gut. This finding again points to the strength of fenugreek as an antidiabetic drug. Background studies on human subjects are now being conducted to transform the knowledge and skill derived from animal studies into human use through appropriate trials. A national pharmaceutical company has signed an agreement with BIRDEM and Dhaka University for scientific rationalization of the existing use of the product by the local population. Lessons Learned Western-trained medical doctors, pharmacologists and pharmaceutical industries in many developing countries have neglected the rich traditions of herbal medicines far too long. As a result, the ethnomedicinal knowledge and vegetative resources are fast-depleting while the majority of the population still has limited access or no access to modern medicines. Lack of awareness about the effective use of plants as medicines and poor understanding of the philosophy and cultural traditions behind ethnomedicinal uses of plants are some of the reasons why plant uses have not been rationalized on a scientific basis. One of the main reasons for the limited number of clinical studies in the developing world is a severe shortage of skilled human resources. Such work demands pharmacologists and toxicologists to conduct scientifically valid clinical studies on plant extracts. Without these studies, large-scale development of drugs cannot occur. In countries like Bangladesh, it often is difficult to form interdisciplinary teams of scientists who are required for such studies. With BIRDEM’s first set of experiments, however, it is evident that, with consistent effort, it is possible to gather an experienced group of chemists who can successfully conduct the phytochemical analyses at an international standard (see below). Several lessons were learned during this study. First, traditional knowledge about the use of various plants as an antidiabetic medicine is usually undocumented, sometimes unreliable, inconsistent, sketchy and often based on myths and stories. However, some plants, including fenugreek, have an unbroken tradition of success and, as a result, are ideal candidates for chemical studies. With the partnerships that were forged, BIRDEM was able to take this traditional knowledge and put it through rigorous scientific tests for clinical and phytochemical investigation. The scientific results supported traditional knowledge in using herbal solutions to combat such human diseases as diabetes mellitus. In addition, the tests provided more specific information on how various extractions and dosages of a particular plant could be used to address diabetes mellitus. Impact BIRDEM faced many obstacles when conducting these tests. Lack of proper infrastructure and trained researchers, as well as an inadequate scientific culture, caused chronic delays. The group focused on overcoming these problems by developing increased institutional support through expanding awareness about the scientific evaluation and potential value of plant materials among policy makers. BIRDEM broadened the national and international collaborations through experimental work. The link between academic and commercial organizations should become both stronger and broader through the additional experimentation that has been planned. Future Plans As a result of the educational program of BIRDEM, plans have been made to educate communities that the folkloric reputation of plants does not always match the real potency of the plant. This is a fact that was revealed by BIRDEM results on a large number of plant materials. Once the clinical trial is completed, the task will be to popularize the practice of administering accurate timing and dosage of fenugreek among its users. As the project grows, BIRDEM hopes to devise herbal solutions to control diseases safely and economically. Such efforts would involve the inclusion of other plants, improvement of the capability of the animal house, laboratories and experimental facilities for clinical pharmacology, and more in-depth studies of plant material both chemically and biologically. To make this economically feasible, BIRDEM will pursue additional agreements with other private enterprises and strengthen ties with other national and international organizations.",

    "abstract": "Just a few decades ago, the Kraho Indian communities in Tocantins state in Brazil discovered that they were not only undermining their region's environmental well-being but worsening their economic plight as well — and, in the process, becoming even more dependent on the government. The shift from itinerant to permanent site cultivation, along with the use of new commercial and modern input-requiring crop varieties, as well as reliance on a single permanent crop system, encouraged the Kraho Indians to adopt agricultural practices that degraded the soil and consequently reduced agricultural productivity. In addition, seed varieties, which had been selected by their ancestors and maintained from generation to generation, began to disappear due to the introduction of modern crop varieties. According to the Krahos, loss of these seeds contributed to a gradual loss of both plant and community roots. The latter, after all, was given life by rituals associated with traditional agricultural methods, the annual rhythms of the agricultural calendar and the food supply. The withering away of agricultural and cultural sustenance forced many Indians to abandon their traditional lands and migrate to already impoverished urban areas. Such movement contributed to the cycle of dependence of entire Indian communities on government welfare programs. In some areas, this dependence led to severe malnutrition due to the inadequacy of grains distributed to the community or caused a lack of food supply for year-round consumption. By the time the Krahos realized that the substitution of their native grain varieties inherited from their ancestors by commercial varieties was a bad decision, the seeds of the ancient varieties had already disappeared. During the search for the original seeds, they found that many varieties fortunately were conserved at the National Center for Research on Genetic Resources and Biotechnology (CENARGEN). In 1976, with the help and financial support of the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI), CENAGEN organized a series of expeditions for germplasm collection in Brazilian Indian lands to collect seeds, tubers, and other material with the aim of rescuing the endangered germplasm. The collected seeds were stored in special chambers for long-term conservation at CENARGEN as well as in other seed banks throughout the country. At CENARGEN, the Krahos have received samples of seeds from the ancient varieties. Based on the information and knowledge of their elderly community members, they have reintroduced their ancestral and traditional agricultural methods, customs and values that were lost when they had unsuccessfully tried to adopt “modern” agriculture. These seeds have brought about the revival of their old and long forgotten traditions related to the cultivation, harvesting, food preparation, and communal ceremonies that are now being taught again by the elderly people to the younger members of the community. The rescue of ancient seed varieties by the Krahos is bringing a gradual improvement in the quality of life due to nutritional improvement, an increase in self-esteem and a return to sustainable agriculture based on traditional farming methods. Following the repatriation of the seeds, the Kraho Indians are again acting as curators of the germplasm of the old varieties cultivated in their regions. Indeed their cultural and natural calendar has served as an efficient mechanism for conserving the genetic resources used by Brazilian Indians for food and agriculture throughout the millennia. For the first time in 500 years, an historic debt is being paid back to the Brazilian Indians, the original inhabitants of the Americas for at least 12,000 years, through the restitution of their seeds.",

    "abstract": "Ancient and Modern Medicinal Herbs: China Ancient and Modern Medicinal Herbs: China Shiling Yang Institute of Medicinal Plant Development (IMPLAD) Beijing, China Chinese medicine represents one of the oldest therapeutic systems in the world. Its roots date back more than 4,000 years and many of the seminal works still used by its practitioners today are based on findings made and recorded 2,500 or more years ago. Put in the simplest of terms, the underlying principal of Chinese medicine is that human beings are at their happiest and healthiest when in harmony with the natural environment. This harmony can be achieved by maintaining the body’s natural “elements” in balance through the wide use of medicinal herbs and such practices as acupuncture and acupressure. In recent decades, Chinese medicine’s holistic approach to health has made it increasingly popular with people living in Western countries. Chinese medical techniques, on their own or in conjunction with those of other holistic or conventional practices, are now used throughout Europe and North America to treat people suffering from a wide range of conditions and complaints. This means that China’s traditional medicinal products have become a valuable potential economic resource. It also means that age-old products are being scientifically scrutinized as never before to bring them in-line with the demands of modern medical practices and standard. It seems fitting, therefore, that since 1996 China’s Institute of Medicinal Plant Development (IMPLAD) in Beijing should be working on ways to preserve and support the use of the country’s rich heritage of medicinal plants. To make their work even more relevant to the needs of a fast-developing country, IMPLAD directed its 1996-1999 programme towards the joint goals of sustainable development and environmental protection. The ambitious series of projects was divided into three main sections, each with a wide range of aims: • Cultivation of Chinese medicinal plants aimed at establishing a germplasm- and gene-pool for medicinal plants; promotion of research on medicinal plant germplasm resources and the breeding of fine varieties; development of large-scale farms where medicinal plants can be cultivated according to prevailing methods and standards; establishment of manufacturing centres to process medicinal plants in an environmentally friendly way; pursuit of new research cultivation techniques as an alternative to harvesting wild medicinal plants; and application of biotechnology for improving the cultivation and usefulness of medicinal plants. • Research and development of new drugs aimed at conducting research to find out the chemistry of natural products; testing on animals; and conducting clinical tests. • And research and development of traditional medicine aimed at establishing effective dosage methods and quantities for Chinese plant products; identifying the plants used; uncovering the bioactive ingredients that make those plants medically useful; improving quality standards; and advancing the equipment and methods used to process the plants into medical products. Background and Justification Until the early 1990s, Chinese government policy for science and technology paid little attention to the international market and tended to neglect ecological issues, forcing institutions to concentrate all their efforts on the more high-technology end of research. IMPLAD found itself side-lined and undervalued. Since its foundation in 1983, a lack of funds had prevented it from conducting any major national projects, while the provincial projects it did carry out were restricted by inadequate facilities. The institute’s pharmaceutical factory, for example, had poor, outdated production equipment, unsatisfactory qualitytesting methods and inefficient machinery for processing the plant products.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, cereal research and improved cultivation have led to more cereals and fewer pulses being grown. This has meant that people, particularly the poor, have lost a valuable source of protein. At the same time, monocropping of cereals has exhausted soils and made cereal cultivation less sustainable. In 1971, the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC) decided to do something about these threats, choosing the development of the mungbean as the focus of its project. The bean is indigenous to Taiwan, where it grows wild as a subsistence crop. As a result, AVRDC decided that it had a good chance of fitting the mungbean into modern, high-yielding grain systems throughout Asia. The first step that AVRDC took was to remove or improve the traits of mungbean that made it an unpopular crop. Among the problems that researchers set out to resolve was that mungbean crops do not mature at once, so farmers have to harvest crops bit by bit, which is very time-consuming. In addition, the bean is low-yielding, slow to mature, susceptible to disease and dull-skinned. Each season, AVRDC screened hundreds of thousands of plants, made crosses and distributed seeds to collaborating farmers who tested the seeds on their farms. The results of all this work were that potential yields more than doubled, crops started to mature at the same time, harvest time was reduced from 100 to 65 days, sensitivity to day-length (photoperiod) was minimized, and disease- and insectresistant lines were developed. Shorter harvest times meant that a mungbean crop can now be grown every year in rotation with a cereal. Research shows that wheat crops grown in such a rotation increase their yields by 20 to 30 percent. Mungbean therefore not only increases the availability of protein but contributes to increased sustainability and profitability of cereal crops. In Pakistan, for instance, mungbean is now grown as a commercial crop, yielding US$20 million annually in sales. Producers benefit from lower production costs, higher productivity and better prices for better quality beans while consumers continue to enjoy lower prices for lower-quality beans. Future research and development plans include efforts to promote increased plant resistance to diseases and insects, even shorter harvest times (to allow cereal-cereal-mungbean rotations), mechanized cultivation practices, and development of tolerance to rain and humidity. To achieve these goals, a mungbean network for South Asia has been established to carry out research backed up by tests and demonstrations on farmers’ fields.",

    "abstract": "Menthol Mint: India Menthol Mint: India Sushil Kumar Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) Lucknow, India Mentha arvensis (commonly known as menthol mint, corn mint or Japanese mint) is widely used in the food, flavourings, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. There are two basic types of menthol mint — natural and synthetic. Synthetic menthol comes in the form of l-menthol crystals that are derived from the plant’s essential oil. Industry, however, prefers the natural version because the scent of synthetic menthol is affected by contaminants that arise during the crystallization process. In addition to being a popular flavouring for food, confectionery and cigarettes, natural menthol has a cooling, soothing effect on the skin and mucous membranes of the human body, making it a useful ingredient in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Worldwide, approximately 10,000 tonnes of natural menthol and 2,000 tonnes of synthetic menthol are used by the pharmacosmetic and cigarette industries every year. Until about 15 years ago, the bulk of the world’s Mentha arvensis came from Brazil and China. China and India subsequently overtook Brazil and, more recently, India has led the world in the production of this useful plant and its products. Mint cultivation was introduced to India as a main rabi season crop in the 1980s, to follow the planting and harvesting rice or pigeon pea kharif crops. Although farmers were able to profit from this planting rotation, mint cultivation did not take off immediately in India because it generated low yields. The situation improved in the 1990s when new, improved varieties that had been developed by India’s Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) were introduced and other varieties were imported from China. After this development, larger areas were planted with mint and CIMAP released another two new varieties (Himalaya and Kosi) leading to India winning its dominant position in world menthol production. This case study is about the latter two cultivars. Background and Justification Over the past few decades, India’s rising population, intensified use of cultivable land, and limited availability of water, pesticides and fertilizers, combined with the country’s need to produce enough food for its people, have increased the pressure for discovering new ways of making the most of land and improving existing production of essential foodstuffs. Mentha arvensis crops were identified as valuable tools for achieving these worthwhile goals. As well as providing farmers with an extra crop every year, the rotation of menthol with other food crops was found to be a good way of helping to control pests and diseases of all the crops planted in the field. Other reasons for selecting menthol mint were that worldwide demand for mint oil had begun (and continues) to increase and the climate and geography of parts of India are ideal for mint production. When the first mint varieties were introduced, two major problems were discovered: first, yields remained low and, second, the time required for the crop to mature made it difficult to fit around other, more important crops such as rice and potatoes. This second problem was particularly significant because the area best-suited to menthol production is also the area in which much of the country’s food crops are grown. The challenge facing CIMAP when it initiated its Improved Technology for Menthol Mint (Mentha arvensis) Essential Oil in India project in 1993 was to find high-yielding, disease- and pestresistant cultivars that could be grown successfully between the harvest of such food crops as potatoes and wheat and the planting of rice in time to benefit from the monsoon season. Continual developments, culminating with CIMAP’s release and follow-up of the Himalaya and Kosi varieties, led to increases in annual menthol oil production from 450 tonnes in 1982 to about 1,200 tonnes in 1999.",

    "abstract": "Zataria multiflora is a thyme-like plant that grows wild in central and southern Iran. It is a member of the Latiatae family to which mint, rosemary and several other medically useful plants also belong. In Iran, Zataria multiflora is used in traditional folk remedies for its antiseptic, analgesic (pain-relieving) and carminative (anti-flatulence and intestine-soothing) properties. Despite its impressive array of medical applications, little research had been carried out on the volatile constituents of this plant — the physical and chemical dimensions that make it behave the way it does. That is why when the Faculty at Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran commenced a project to assess Zataria multiflora as a wild plant for medical use in 1994, it began by analyzing the essential oil of the plant’s aerial parts — the parts that grow above the ground. The essential oil is obtained by distilling or pressing the plant’s leaves, roots, fruits, seeds, stems and/or flowers. Basically, the essential oil contains the plant’s “essence” — a complex chemical that provides its smell and other properties, including those that make it medically useful. Once scientists had studied the oil, they measured and recorded its antimicrobial activity (its ability to kill off microbes). Zataria multiflora was found to perform well in terms of containing adequate quantities of effective active chemicals that could be used in pharmacology to produce medicines. On the basis of these findings and in collaboration with the Tolid Dara Pharmaceutical Company, the project team has developed two drug formulations: (1) broncho TDA syrup, an expectorant and cough suppressant, and (2) an antimicrobial and antifungal mouth wash. In addition, a vaginal douche and painrelieving cream are currently under development.",

    "abstract": "For more than 30 years, the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA) has been researching the traditional medicines and food plants of Madagascar that, despite being nutritionally and medically valuable, often are overlooked and underused by local people. This case study is about one of IMRA’s most interesting and successful projects. Eugenia jambolana Lamark is a species of big tree that grows on the central high plateau and east coast of Madagascar. It is a member of the Myrtaceae family to which myrtles belong. Eugenia jambolana produces small purple plums, called java plums (or rotra in Malagasy), that have a very sweet flavor, turning slightly astringent on the edges of the pulp as the fruit becomes mature. Java plums are rich in sugar, mineral salts, vitamins C and PP (which fortifies the beneficial effects of vitamin C), anthocyans, flavenoids and other useful ingredients. Although Malagasy folk healers have successfully used Eugenia jambolana to relieve the symptoms of diabetes, its full potential has never been exploited. In addition, the fruit could be made into make jams, jellies and health drinks, but a general lack of knowledge and interest exists in collecting, using and preserving java plums. Until IMRA launched its valorization of Eugenia jambolana project in 1970, much of this valuable resource had been ignored and left to go to waste. The project's main aims were, first, to identify ways of using the plant and its fruit and, then, to introduce these techniques and products to the public. Although ways of preserving the fruit to produce a range of tasty and healthy foods were one on the project’s outputs, most of the work went towards developing the potential of Eugenia jambolana seeds in the treatment of diabetes and building on the experience and informal findings of centuries of local usage. The result was a commercially produced drug called Madeglucyl®, which has since been widely used by Malagasy diabetes patients. Along the way, scientists worked to find the best ways of collecting the original plant material, which meant training hundreds of rural families to identify the best seeds to pick. Ways of preserving the seeds were another aspect of scientific study. Researchers also concentrated on making this product acceptable and attractive to the country’s population. In this effort they were aided by its appeal as a safe, natural drug with no toxic side-effects. Finally, issues of industrial production and commercialization within Madeglucyl® had to be addressed.",

    "abstract": "The island of Borneo is home to many diverse ethnic communities, each with its own unique way of life for which traditional medicines and cures play an important part. These therapies have been around for far longer than modern medical practices and are so well-rooted in local culture that even today when modern medicines are widely available throughout the island, traditional cures and treatments continue to be used instead of, or alongside, the newcomers. Borneo is politically divided between Malaysia and Indonesia. This project concerns the provinces of Sabah and Sarawak, which are part of Malaysia. Plants and plant materials are important elements in the island’s ancient medical systems. About 1,000 of the plant species that grow in Borneo’s forests are already known to be useful for the treatment of a plethora of diseases and conditions. These 1,000 species are obviously the first port of call for any systematic study of medicinal plants. However, given that they represent only 10 percent of the total number of species found in Borneo’s forests, there is a good chance that scientific research and technology will eventually be able to identify many other valuable plants. This is particularly exciting in terms of the potential for socio-economic development because, while many of these plants are endemic to Borneo, scientists and pharmaceutical companies throughout the developed and developing worlds are turning more and more to tropical plants and traditional medicines in their hunt for new ways of tackling illnesses, including emerging such diseases as cancer and AIDS. At the same time, however, deforestation and other human activities are causing the rapid destruction and disappearance of natural habitats and pushing many medicinal plant species to the brink of extinction. Thus there is an urgent need to carry out detailed studies of Borneo’s plants and their medically useful properties before it is too late. Logging operations, for example, are damaging between 30 and 70 percent of the surviving forests and, if conservation efforts are not intensified, an alarming number of plant species are likely to die out forever. In 1993, the University of Malaysia at Sarawak (UNIMAS) launched a long-term, multidisciplinary study of the medicinal plants used by Borneo’s ethnic groups. The main objective of this ongoing study has been to preserve traditional medical materials and knowledge by protecting both from the pressures inflicted by modern medical beliefs and modern industrial activities and by ensuring that their raw plant ingredients do not disappear. The best way to make sure that this happens is to find ways of making the knowledge and plants useful to the modern world. As well as documenting existing plant products and their known uses, UNIMAS collaborates with a Japanese pharmaceutical company on a drug discovery programme to develop and test new medicines. The programme uses a method called high-throughput (HTP) screening that is based on robotic technology and capable of screening more than a million samples a year. Such robotic technology is expensive to install and maintain. As a result, it is only useful when very large numbers of samples are available for testing. That makes the partnership — between resource-rich Malaysia (with its 10,000 plant species in Borneo alone) and technology-rich Japan — the ideal solution.",

Over 18 months, farmers from the eight states in southwestern Nigeria were surveyed to discover how the plant was being used. During this period, samples of two biotypes of this plant were collected for a greenhouse study on propagation using the stem cuttings and seeds as well as a chemical analysis of the plant. In this study, C. biafrae, which was raised from stem cuttings, branches and canopy spread, was compared to those raised from seeds. The study discovered that the nutrient contents for the two treatments did not differ significantly. A key finding is that stem/vine cutting is the best planting material for the propagation of C. biafrae and that the nutrient contents compare favorably with the cultivated species. Preliminary investigations have revealed that the vegetable is rich in nutrients while the ethnobotanical survey showed that farmers use the juice extract from fresh leaves to stop bleeding caused by injury and illness. The innovative aspect of the research is that it is the first time an attempt has been made to propagate C. biafrae in southwestern Nigeria where people traditionally have eaten it as a vegetable and used it for medicinal purposes. A review of the literature indicates that information is lacking on deliberate cultivation of C. biafrae. This study therefore represents pioneer research on the propagation of this plant as a food and medicinal product.",

    "abstract": "For centuries, the people of South Africa have eaten the leaves of Agathosma betulina (known as buchu) to relieve stomach complaints. Powdered dried leaves are also mixed with sheep fat to produce an ointment that gives the skin a healthy sheen and is antibiotic. When Dutch settlers arrived in the 17th century, later followed by British settlers in the late 19th century, they too used this useful plant to treat a range of ailments. Today, buchu is one of three South African medicinal plants that is used in international medicine. In addition to its therapeutic qualities, the plant’s oil has a distinct blackcurrant smell and flavour, which makes it an excellent ingredient in food flavourings and aromatic oils. In recent years, growing popularity at home and abroad has led to increased exploitation of wild buchu supplies, jeopardizing the plant’s future survival. In August 1999, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) of South Africa initiated a project to protect the country’s indigenous genetic material, prevent buchu from becoming extinct, create jobs and serve the national economy. The main aims and outcomes of this effort are to: • Cultivate buchu commercially to reduce harvesting from the wild and make the plant more attractive to overseas users who do not approve of putting natural resources at risk. • Build gene banks to safeguard traditional varieties and develop new ones through farmers’ experiments. • Adapt varieties from the gene banks to suit local conditions and meet the demands of international markets. Such efforts discourage harvesting from the wild because adapted varieties have higher concentrations of useful ingredients and are therefore more valuable. At the same time, research institutions can earn money from royalties on the new cultivars they produce. • Establish an organic certification scheme for South Africa to help increase awareness of organic cultivation methods, especially for indigenous medicinal and other natural products. • Share research results with farmers through, for instance, guidelines on the cultivation of buchu and new improved seed germination techniques. • Develop ways of cultivating buchu in a hydoponics system — that is, in sand, liquid or gravel, without soil. • Improve marketing practices to increase producer profits, for example, by exporting buchu oil rather than the plant’s less lucrative dried leaves. • Encourage commercial buchu production in disadvantaged communities to give the communities more power and, ultimately, to help South Africa’s economic development. • The main activities of the ARC project are: • Conducting crop science research on how to propagate and cultivate buchu. • Conserving genetic material in a gene bank. • Fostering community development by using buchu cultivation as a source of income and jobs. • Patenting high-quality clones and breeding cultivars to protect the South African buchu industry from foreign competitors. • Establishing a nursery to supply good-quality buchu to industry and, particularly, resource-poor farmers. • Conveying the benefits of growing buchu to the agricultural community. • Forging partnerships to share information and technology as a way of advancing the project and using existing knowledge and expertise. • Building marketing channels to boost consumer demand and prices.",

    "abstract": "Swaziland, a small country covering 17,400 km2, has an interesting geographical terrain that encompasses virtually every feature of the African continent. Such diverse terrain is attributed to its range of climate zones: the highveld (with an altitude of 900 -1400 m), the midveld (with an elevation of 400-800 m), the lowveld (with an elevation of 200-400 m) and the Lubombo plateau (with an elevation of 600 m.) provide a rich diversity of flora. Plants are used extensively in Swazi traditional medicine. In the 1970s, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Swaziland decided to examine the scientific basis for this traditional medical system. In the process of researching drugs derived from medicinal plants, researchers began to understand the important cultural heritage that supported this system. The work has involved analyses of medicinal plants collected by rural people familiar with the traditional medical system. A key part of the studies are the ethnobotanical surveys of medicinal plants administered by traditional medical practitioners (TMP's) and the taxonomic identification of plant species by taxonomists with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. Chemical screening and extraction of possible active constituents is also conducted with TMPs as an integral part of the laboratory team. The benefits are obvious: On the one hand, TMPs help establish the dosage used in the preparation of mixtures; on the other hand, they learn good laboratory practices. Today, this work is housed in the Swaziland Center for Research in Medicinal and Indigenous Food Plants. As a result of the center's research on medicinal plants, the scientific bases of the use of traditional plants for therapeutic purposes has been established. Among the species of flora studied are plants of pharmacological interest and plants of pest-repellant value. Many of the plants identified occur in abundance in the wild and can be harnessed in a sustainable manner. In addition, some endangered and commercial species are being propagated with the use of the soil conditioner, eco-agrogel. Three of the plants TMPs have identified as a constituent of a \"morning after\" contraceptive mixture were sent to the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Center at the University of Illinois (USA) for biological screening. This collaboration complements the phytochemical work. Molluscicidal activities from extracts of plants from Swazi flora have been investigated and propagation studies have been carried out in hopes of fighting an endemic disease called Schistosomiasis, or Bilharzia, that infects 25 percent of the Swazi population. Such plants as Phytolacca dodecandra and Urginea epigea were identified as indigenous plants with high molluscicidal activities. Work on indigenous food plants begun more recently has focused on collection and propagation of plants with the help of indigenous women who have extensive knowledge of the plants. Cultivation of medicinal and indigenous food plants using agronomic methods is an important means of preserving germplasm with potential of large-scale production. Ethnobotanical surveys and phytochemical analyses of possible active compounds have been done simultaneously with a study of the socio-cultural beliefs and rituals underpinning the use of plants in traditional medicine. This approach emphasizes the holistic nature of traditional medicine and works towards its integration into a modern health care system. The propagation of indigenous plants has been carried out in the home of one of the local women and the university nursery. Involvement of traditional practitioners in the collection of medicinal plants and experimental work has been adopted by many African institutions because it is viewed as an innovation that helps cultivate trust between scientists and TMPs. On a practical level, it also helps establish dosage use and proper preparation of the plant mixtures and usage.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE /INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE In September 1978, an international conference on Primary Health Care (PHC), jointly sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), attracted delegates from 134 countries to Alma Ata, the capital of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. The objectives of the conference were basically to define, promote and obtain universal endorsement of and commitment to PHC. Prac- tically all nations became signatories to the Alma Ata Declaration. The conference was a useful opportunity for representatives of different countries to exchange experiences on prior PHC-like programs. But probably the most salient result of the meeting was its unanimous endorsement of the PHC approach as envisioned by the WHO. PHC was identified as the key to 4 PART I :  BASIC NEEDS AND SOCIAL SERVICES attaining the goal of “Health for All by the year 2000”. “Health for All” had been adopted as a goal by the World Health Assembly in 1977, and was de- fined as “the attainment by all peoples of a level of health permitting them to lead socially and economically productive lives” (WHO, 198 1). Not only was the WHO’s definition of PHC ratified, but the conference appeared to put the stamp of expert and governmental approval on some of the operational modes supported by the WHO, notably the use of paraprofessionals or auxiliary health workers in lieu of physicians for the rapid extension of services in the Third World. This contradicted the physician - based models promoted by the Soviet Union and Cuba, but was deemed more appropriate in light of the constraints facing developing countries (WHO/ UNICEF, 1978: p. 62). At its subsequent (1979) meeting, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Alma Ata Report and Declaration and approved a measure encouraging WHO member nations to formulate national, regional and global strategies of Health for All with PHC playing a central role, espe- cially in developing countries (WHO, 1982: p. 5) . In the Philippines, the government as well as the non-governmental agen- cies rushed to launch PHC in recognition of the Alma Ata Declaration. The Commitment of the Philippine government to attaining the goal of Health for All in the year 2000 is embodied in the Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 949 issued by the President of the Republic of the Philippines, the late President Marcos, on October 19, 1979. It mandated the Ministry of Health (MOH) to adopt PHC as an approach to the development and implementation of pro- grams which focus on health development at the community level. This re- flected the country’s recognition of the inter-relatedness of health and devel- opment, expressed as follows: “The attainment of health for all Filipinos is both a means and an end of the overall national development program of the New Society; ... health and health-related activities of the overall national development program . . . (MOH’s LO1 949, 1979).” However, it has been claimed that PHC has had a long history in the Philippines even before the Alma Ata Declaration or the issuance of LO1 949 (CPHC, 1985; Galvez-Tan, 1987; Pesigan, Caragay and Lorenzo, 1992; Veneracion, 1993; Carabeo, 1994). Some medical practitioners from the pri- vate sector had been reaching out to the community from the late 1960s. A few examples of these were De la Paz of the Katiwala Program in Davao City, Viterbo of Roxas City, Macagba of La Union, Flavier of the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, Campos of the University of the Philippines Com- prehensive Community Health Program, Solon of the Paknaan Club Institute of Medicine Project and Wale of Silliman University. However, their efforts COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS 5 were limited to their own territories and they were not able to extend their programs on a national level (Galvez-Tan, 1987). It was only when the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines launched their pilot community-based health programs (CBHPs) in 1975 that a nationwide movement commenced. The Rural Missionaries first studied the prototypes mentioned earlier and, using the Catholic Church network, initiated programs in Luzon (Isabela), Visayas (Leyte) and Mindanao (Lanao del Norte). Their experiences were eventually adopted by the Protestant National Council of Churches in the Philippines in 1977 and Alay Kapwa Kilusang Pangkalusugan (AKAP) in 1978, both of which established nationwide networks. At present, these CBHPs have national and regional coordinating bodies. The Council for Health and Development (CHD) oversees the national coordination. The Ministry of Health commenced a Research and Development project in PHC in 1978 with technical and funding support from international organi- zations such as the WHO. However, it was only in 1981 that the nationwide implementation of PHC started. As of 1985, according to Department of Health documents, the “Primary Health Care approach [was] officially working in all barangays [communities] except for one per cent of these wherein there [was] an unstable peace and order situation.” Five years before the adoption of PHC in the country, the CBHPs already practiced its basic principles. Although the CBHPs have jointly worked with the government through the Department of Health in the propagation of PHC, it did not take long for them to feel that there was a lack of political will on the part of the government to correctly implement PHC. While CBHPs recog- nized the Alma Ata Declaration, they claimed that it fell short of accurately diagnosing the root of the health problems in the country. The comprehensive concept of PHC had reverted to selective PHC as a result of political, eco- nomic and practical factors. PHC became equated with episodic campaigns and basic services couched in child-survival rhetoric (e.g., Growth Monitor- ing, Oral Dehydration, Breastfeeding and Immunization). The poor health situation of the Philippines is a reflection of the poverty of the people. The common health problems of the people include malnutri- tion, high infant mortality rate, poor environmental sanitation, lack of safe potable water supply, high incidence of communicable diseases, maldistribution of health personnel and facilities, and prohibitive cost of medical care. The health-care system in the country as a whole has been and is still highly dependent on the West in terms of technology, organization, training, education and research. This kind of dependency has made the health system inadequate and ill-equipped to handle the health problems of a country (or a region) that is largely underdeveloped. 6 PART I :  BASIC NEEDS AND SOCIAL SERVICES",

    "abstract": "THE PRACTICE/lNNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE According to IPEA (a research office for the Ministry of Planning), there are about 32 million people living below the poverty line in Brazil, equally spread throughout urban and rural areas'. The largest concentration of people living below the poverty line is found in the northeast region and in metro- politan areas. Sixty percent of the rural poor live in the northeast. Even though the consumption of food on average is 7.5% greater in rural compared to urban areas, given the importance of non-marketable subsistence production in the former, malnutrition indices are worse for the rural population because of the lack of sewage facilities and health care. Hunger in Brazil cannot be explained as stemming from a deficient food supply. Grain production (rice, beans, corn, soybeans and wheat) in 1993 reached a record level of 70 million tons. If we accept the Food and Agricul- ture Organization's (FAO) recommendation of a minimum daily diet of 2,242 calories and 53 g of protein, available supplies2 of food are greater than re- quired to cover the needs for calories and proteins of the population. The average grain production of the country for the last seven years (59 million tons) would still be able to supply 3,280 calories and 87 g of protein a day to every person. Given its natural resources and its productive potential which is still largely unexplored, Brazil is actually able to produce food for internal consumption and still be left with a significant exportable surplus. Some estimates indicate that, even without technical innovations, it is possible to triple production. Deficient infrastructure in transportation, storage and handling causes losses estimated at 20% of output. If on the supply side, the problems seem solv- able, it is the demand side that poses the toughest difficulty - lack of purchas- ing power affecting a large part of the population. 24 PART I: BASIC NEEDS AND SOCIAL SERVICES Unemployment is part of the problem, but disguised unemployment is much worse. Precarious and underpaid jobs do not allow a large number of people to rise above extreme poverty. Thus, even among those who have jobs, 19.7% earn less than the legal minimum wage (about US$ 80 a month), a value that is considered insufficient to cover the minimum requirements of decent living. In rural areas, the situation is even worse, where up to 41 % of workers receive less than the minimum wage (in the state of Ceara). Precari- ous employment is indicated by the fact that 34.7% of employees do not have any formal contract and that 14.2% of children between the ages of 10 and 13 have to work, even though Brazilian labor laws forbid hiring children under 14 years of age3. There is a general consensus that extreme poverty in rural areas results mainly from the extremely concentrated structure of land ownership. About 1 % of landowners hold 44% of the land, while 67% of owners own just 6%. Forty-four percent of the families living under the poverty line are found in rural areas, even though three-quarters of the total population live in urban areas. A similar picture is produced from the data on earnings. In Brazil, aver- age monthly earnings reach 4.1 times the minimum wage but this average is 4.9 times in the southeast against only 2.1 times in the northeast. And impor- tant as it is, land concentration is only one of the factors explaining income concentration. Gender and race factors are also relevant: average monthly earnings for males are 4.9 times the minimum wage, but only 2.8 times for females: white males earn, on average, 6.3 times the minimum wage, while black women earn 1.7 times the minimum wage.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE The Philippines is a disaster-prone country. An average of 20 typhoons ravage the country each year, affecting millions of Filipinos and leaving a trail of deaths, injuries and damage to property worth billions of pesos (mil- lions of US dollars). Typhoon casualties and damage are brought about by floods, landslides, and wind-battered homes and farm crops. In 1996, eight typhoons brought heavy rains and destructive winds which adversely affected some 1,669,643 people. Over 3,600 families lost their homes while 35,000 families had partially ruined homes. The typhoons left 94 people dead, 75 injured and 25 reported missing. The country also lies within the Pacific Ring of Fire where 80% of the world’s earthquakes occur. At least 21 of the country’s 220 volcanoes are considered active and are scattered all over the archipelago populated by 68 million Filipinos. The situation is worsened by the wanton degradation of the country’s environment and natural resources. The main culprits of such large-scale en- vironmental destruction in the country are factories, mining companies and loggers. The worst fishkill in Manila Bay happened in October 1996, during which an estimated 30,000 kilos of dead fish were found floating in the bay’s shallow shores. This prompted the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) to probe the disaster. The Bureau’s findings: the fish died of low oxygen levels and internal bleeding when their internal organs absorbed toxic 34 PART I: BASIC NEEDS AND SOCIAL SERVICES chemicals. The chemicals were traced to the industrial refuse various facto- ries had been dumping in Manila Bay. The fishkill disrupted the livelihood of thousands of fishing families. The country’s worst mining disaster in recent history happened in March 1996 when the Filipino-Canadian Marcopper Mining Corporation’s mine tail- ings spilled into the Boac River in Marinduque in central Philippines. The spill practically killed the river which supplied the local folk’s drinking water, farm irrigation and freshwater fish. Another fact of life in the Philippines is another human-made disaster: militarization. The problem of militarization began under the late Ferdinand Marcos’s martial law regime (September 1972 - February 1986). This prob- lem has bred what the Citizens’ Disaster Response Center (CDRC) calls “in- ternal refugees”. These are villagers, including women and children, forced out of their homes because of militarization. Also in the countryside, villagers are vulnerable to forced evictions by private firms. Residents of 16 villages in 1996 were displaced in Davao Ori- ental Province in Mindanao island in southern Philippines, for example, to give way to the tree plantation of a timber company. Yet another human-made disaster occurs from time to time in the heart of Manila: urban poor dwellers forced out of their shacks to give way to devel- opment projects such as condominiums, megamalls, factories and other corn- mercial establishments. In Manila alone in 1996, CDRC documented 72 inci- dents of demolition, rendering some 193,326 persons homeless. CDRC also considers as disastrous the economic dislocation resulting from factory lockouts and deadlocks in collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) between workers and employers. In 1996, CDRC listed at least 69,789 workers, upon whom some 369,882 family members depend, who lost their jobs because of CBA deadlocks and shutdown or closure of firms. All these natural and human-made disasters plus the acute poverty among most Filipinos create a magnified disaster situation. This complex situation gave birth to the establishment of CDRC in 1984. CDRC recognizes that a developing country like the Philippines faces greater difficulty in coping with both natural and human-made disasters. This is because poverty-stricken victims lack the means to cushion the effects of disasters. Recovery is also difficult and tedious. CDRC has thus focused on developing disaster management programs to help prepare community folk in wrestling and coping with the impact of dis- asters and to help hasten their recovery. It also ensures that assistance to ben- eficiaries is geared toward improving their economic condition to make them less vulnerable to disasters. The teach-them-how-to-fish-rather-than-giving- them-fish approach is CDRC’s formula. Otherwise, disaster victims would DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND MANAGEMENT INNOVATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES 35 become dependent on handouts. CDRC’s disaster response and management programs are thus anchored to the following needs of beneficiaries: economic capacity-building and more participation in decision-making. CDRC’s programs also affirm the right of people to a healthy environ- ment and equal access to the country’s abundant natural resources.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/IDNNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE In 1972, the state of Maharashtra went through a severe drought crisis. The drought hit several hundred villages with a combined population of more than 400,000 people. During his travels around the drought-affected areas, Vilasrao Salunkhe was struck by the fact that in several areas, there was no water available for agriculture of any kind. Villagers had no means of sur- vival. The government of Maharashtra had-determined that the villagers should continue to work by preparing road construction materials to enable them to receive a subsistence wage from it under its employment schemes. Salunkhe found that though farmers owned land, they could do nothing with it without access to a guaranteed source of water for cultivation. This was the principal cause of their poverty. Since there was no water, they could never employ themselves on the land and earn an assured income. In drought- prone areas, this was the fate of both large and small landowners. No villager wanted to be on the dole as it were: they wanted water so they could cultivate. At the moment, they were not asking for water all year round. They wanted water supply guaranteed every year for at least one single crop. Since there was no prospect of this happening, people were leaving the vil- lages and migrating to cities like Mumbai where they could at least eke out a living on the pavements or in the slums. Salunkhe found that the problem could be solved if attempts were made by the farmers themselves to conserve the scanty rainfall that the region re- ceives every year. His primary task was to perfect a watershed-management plan which he first put into effect on land gifted to him by the villages. Through well-established schemes of water conservation and afforestation, Salunkhe THE PANI PANCHAYAT: WATER AND EQUITY 53 was able to harness enough water to transform the area into a green oasis. This was his technical success. The more significant aspect of the devel- opment work was the social aspect, relating to the problem of equity. Histori- ans have pointed out that not only were the older water-harvesting systems for which India is well known communally owned but the benefits were shared far more equitably than they are nowadays. In certain regions like south India, even lands were rotated among peasants by lots every few years to enable everyone in the community to get access to the most fertile of the village lands. But this principle of just access was not incorporated into policy. Even today, despite the fact that the government agencies have accepted the idea that watersheds must be developed holistically, equity considerations have not been addressed in the implementation of programmes. In fact, every development project in India today continues to suffer from the problem of equity or rather the lack of it. Invariably, while some people benefit from a project installed, often with public funds, other people pay. Some receive water from a dam, others are displaced in the process. Even in the command areas of irrigation schemes, those with large landholdings get copious quantities of water, whereas those with small holdings and those at the margins of the command get little of it. Salunkhe was determined to end this state of affairs. He resolved that in the schemes he started, the equity problem would be tackled from the inception. This he ensured by insisting that every person in a development area in which a water-harvesting project was coming up would get an equal share of the water. This principle of guar- anteed water shares would apply whether the person owned land or not. The innovation had profound implications, for it gave the landless an economic (and, therefore, bargaining) power that had always been denied them because they did not own land. Two other major problems were associated with water. First, available supplies in well-endowed areas were unjustly distributed. Water supplies from large dams and irrigation projects, including lift irrigation schemes, invariably benefited largely the richer farmers. Rich farmers could also command resources with which to undertake lift irrigation projects in which they alone benefited while the rest of the community was left to fend on its own. In addition, most of the good water available even in drought- prone areas was being used for water-intensive cash crops like sugarcane in- stead of for the growing of food grains. Salunkhe’s technological and social innovations provided neat solutions to some of the most serious of these prob- lems and are therefore seen as one of the really useful and significant contri- butions made to rural development and welfare. 54 PART I: BASIC NEEDS AND SOCIAL SERVICES",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Shelter is a basic need that any human being aspires to fulfill. The Fili- pino, for one, would work himself ragged, even to the extent of leaving his loved ones for greener pastures abroad, if only to someday own his own house and lot. The Filipino’s concept of a house assumes a psycho-social dimen- sion, and not just a physical one, as can be gleaned from the synonyms of the word bahay (house). The Filipinos’ bahay is their tirahan (a place to stay in), their tuluyan (a place to go to), their uwian (a place to return to), their tuhunun (a place to rest in) (Constantino, 1987: 1). Owning a house connotes economic security which, in turn, brings about peace of mind. Unluckily, the realization of this cherished dream has been elusive not only for the Filipinos but also for many people all over the world. The following facts can bear this out: (a) According to United Nations statistics, more than one billion people live in very poor housing, in unhealthy environments. Of this number, 100 million are literally homeless. They sleep in the streets, in vacant lots, or huddled against inclement weather under bridges and alleys. (b) Still according to UN statistics, around one-half of the urban population live in slums. 62 PART I :  BASIC NEEDS AND SOCIAL SERVICES (c) IBON Facts and Figures of September 15, 1987 cites official estimates that 3.5 million families or roughly 21 million Filipinos are homeless and that 10.8 million (out of a total 12.9 million) households are in need of better housing, almost 84% of the Philippine population. (d) In Metro Manila alone, there were 425 slum colonies as of 1981 with a total squatter population of 1.6 million; that is to say, more than one- fourth of Metro Manila’s population were squatters. And this phenom- enon is not confined to only Metro Manila; all major cities of the country have slum areas in which large numbers live. In Bacolod, 30% live in slums; in Davao City, the figure is 33%; in Cotabato City, 34%. (e) In Baguio City, an additional 26,800 units need to be constructed to meet the growing population’s housing demand by the year 2000 (Boquiren, 1991). The SLU-SVP Housing Project was indeed a timely response to the need for housing not only for the lower-income group, but also for the middle- income professionals in Baguio City, like Attorney Ruben A. Corpuz. Corpuz narrates his experience thus: “Way back in 1971, I was just employed as an instructor in St. Louis University, Baguio City. I had been married for only a year then and my first child was born. With a salary of P380.00, I could only afford to rent one room for everything - it served as a bedroom, kitchen and dining room. Like many others in Baguio, I was in need of better housing. “My case was no better than that of the parishioners of St. Vincent Parish who were living around a lagoon whose waters rise every time the typhoons come. Every year during typhoons, I hear over the radio people around the lagoon being rescued by volunteers. The parish priest was concerned with procuring a better housing facility for these parishioners.” The housing problem in the Philippines is of course a result of poverty. With around 60% of the Filipino people living below the poverty line, with 14% of the workforce unemployed and 22% underemployed, with a mini- mum wage that consigns even those who have jobs to living below the pov- erty line, one can only expect slums to expand. There is also the natural popu- lation growth rate to swell the slum population. Moreover, there is the con- tinuous flow of migrants from the countryside escaping from the depressed rural economy and hoping for a better chance in the urban economy (Constantino, 1987). There is also the basic problem of land - not so much its scarcity, but more the “monopoly ownership that gives the appearance of scarcity and con- sequently pushes land prices beyond the reach of the poor or even the not-so- poor”. THE SLU-SVP HOUSING PROJECT 63 Finally, the housing problem can be directly linked to misguided govern- ment policies, and, where policy is sound, the absence/lack of proper imple- mentation of such policies.",

College Baguio since 1986. 96 PART I :  BASIC NEEDS AND SOCIAL SERVICES flecting on the true meaning of U.P. education, and assessing how the Univer- sity has played, and continues to play, its role as a social critic, catalyst and agent of change. As an institution supported by the people, U.P. has a commitment to so- cial transformation, which means empowering the people and improving the conditions of the poor majority. The U.P. faculty, students and alumni have the knowledge and skills that can be harnessed to help transform Philippine society. With the majority of the Filipino people still grappling with problems of survival, the University is expected to mobilize its constituents to realize their social responsibility and commitment. The ideals of nationalism and democracy promoted at the University, cou- pled with strong adherence to academic freedom, have instilled among many of its constituents the desire to be of service to the people. Through the years, many among the U.P. faculty, students, alumni and even the non-academic staff have involved themselves in different kinds of voluntary work in various ways. Although many individual members of the University have practiced voluntarism, their involvement did not really benefit from concrete institu- tional support. For the most part, the many voluntary activities of the U.P. faculty, students, alumni and non-teaching staff were done in the volunteers’ individual capacities. There was, in general, no institutional involvement and support to speak of. In February 1994, under the initiative of U.P. President Emil Javier, the University launched its volunteer service program called the Ugnayan ng Pahinungod/Oblation Corps (UP/OC). The program was envisioned as a way of “institutionalizing the spirit of social commitment and service that has marked the U.P. since it was founded in 1908” (Flores, 1996). Why institutionalize a volunteer service program? What good does it do the University? Why should U.P. as an academic institution engage in voluntarism? President Javier provides the answer, in expounding his concept of a modern university: “A modem university has four main functions: instruction, research, ex- tension and public service, and the preservation and transmission of culture. Voluntarism can be most clearly seen as performing the third function, that of extension and public service. In the actual act of serving, the university would be similar to other volunteer programs. It is in its conscious connections and contributions to the performance of the other three functions and in its ration- ale and capacity to perform public service that a university program is distin- guished from all other forms of voluntarism.” INSTITUTIONALIZING VOLUNTARISM: THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES EXPERIENCE 97 In other words, while voluntarism is directly related to a university’s func- tion of extension and public service, a university’s involvement in volunteer work can also enhance its three other functions. Voluntarism and the function of extension and public service Voluntarism is one mechanism in the performance of a university’s task of extension and public service. A university engages in extension and public service in order for it to share with society what it has analyzed and discov- ered. More than this, state-run universities like U.P. must engage in extension and public service because they owe it to society, which supports them. In performing extension and public service, a university can tap its vast resources, embodied in its faculty, students and alumni. Voluntarism and the function of instruction Voluntarism enhances instruction. Universities engaged in volunteer work may be able to validate theories taught inside the classroom. In the process of voluntary work, the university is able to get feedback on whether its theories work and are applicable in real life. At the same time, universities can look at voluntarism as “an object of study and discourse” (Javier, 1995). A universi- ty’s involvement in volunteer work can promote voluntarism and related top- ics as a subject of scholarship and instruction. Voluntarism can also teach the young ethics and values like selflessness, human dignity, social justice, love of country and service to others. Moreover, older members of the academe already engaged in volunteer work might find further strength in pursuing their involvement with institutional support, while others may rediscover the psychological rewards that go with voluntarism. Hence, voluntarism may help in molding the character of universities’ con- stituents, especially among the students, which is one role of education. Uni- versities engaged in voluntarism have the edge in equipping their students with not only the needed skills and knowledge to prepare them to become competent leaders of the country, but also important ethics and values that would inspire them to truly work for the betterment of the people. Voluntarism and the function of research Voluntarism offers a fertile ground for research. The experience and knowl- edge generated from actual volunteer work can be used in the formulation of new theories on the role of voluntarism in society. 98 PART I: BASIC NEEDS AND SOCIAL SERVICES Voluntarism and the function of culture preservation and transmission There is a cultural basis for universities to engage in voluntarism. Across cultures, there are practices that may be classified as voluntary involvement of communities working together for the common good. In the Philippines, for instance, we have the bayanihan in the lowlands or the ub-ubbo in the Cordillera region, both of which call for the sharing of work among commu- nity folk. As Javier asserts, voluntarism may be inherent to all cultures, be- cause “it is a means of affirming one’s sense of community with fellow hu- mans.” This means that as universities engage in voluntary work, they are at the same time promoting the time-honored tradition of voluntarism in society. All these point to the idea that pursuing and promoting voluntarism within a university is a good in itself not only because it enhances and helps the university in performing its functions as an academic institution. More than this, voluntarism may help bridge the gap between the academe and the com- munity in general. It is one way of making universities truly sensitive and responsive to the needs of the people.",

    "abstract": "THE PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE The idea of establishing a databank was born out of necessity. The databank was set up because of the dearth of information under the late ex-president Ferdinand Marcos’ martial law regime (September 1972 to February 1986). During that period, information flow had been controlled by the regime and the public felt the need for more objective data and information on what was really happening and what the social and economic trends were in the coun- try. Throughout the martial law period, people’s organizations, religious groups, workers, farmers, students, professionals and other sectors were seeking ways to understand and help ease the prevailing social conditions. But they needed informed judgment on issues such as the rising foreign debt, wide- spread poverty, heavy military spending, how much of the national budget was going to social services, unemployment and the like. They needed data and information to help educate, organize and mobilize people in relation to the excesses of martial rule. They needed a databank or a research group. This urgency led to the birth of IBON Foundation, which was known then as IBON Databank. (Note: In the succeeding parts of this research, the Foundation is referred to as “IBON’ for short.) From a borrowed space in a counseling office of a Catholic Sisters’ con- vent, IBON Databank’s pioneer staff labored. They pored over and thumbed through government data from government agencies and from the govern- ment-controlled newspapers. Using a borrowed typewriter and a borrowed mimeographing machine, IBON came out with its first published issue called IBON Facts & Figures in August 1978. 116 PART II: EDUCATION AND INFORMATION The publication, at first, was a mere collage of data. But it later evolved into an alternative way of presenting issues, from what the IBON founders call the “people’s perspective”. IBON Databank did not only present issues from another angle; it also presented alternatives or some way out of the prob- lems martial rule created. ZBON Facts & Figures became a hit among “cause-oriented groups” (as the various people’s and sectoral organizations opposing martial law were called then). Focusing on socio-economic issues, the publication became the basis and reference for group discussions on the country’s economic status, labor and farmers’ concerns, foreign debt and the like. Its main purpose, there- fore, was to service the information needs of people’s organizations. If these people’s organizations used the information to help arouse, mobi- lize and organize people, then this was so because, as IBON had envisioned it, information can be a tool for enlightenment and social transformation. The martial law regime tried to curtail the public’s right to be informed. IBON Databank was among those institutions which tried their best to help people from being kept in the dark. From its early days, IBON established its distinctive competence. ZBON Facts & Figures became known as a concise and handy twice-monthly, eight- page fact sheet which made economic concepts and developments understand- able to non-economists. A few months after its first publication, ZBON Facts & Figures was succeeded by two local-language editions. This was followed by IBON Industry Primers on mining, garments, fishing, oil, industrial es- tates, commercial banks, footwear, beverages and drugs, among others. These publications had a common goal: to help empower the grassroots by disseminating in popular terms information on and analyses of socio-eco- nomic realities. Having established its reputation in interpreting and analyzing economic trends and developments, IBON in summer 1980 launched its Seminars Project. Coordinated with the Education Forum, another non-governmental organiza- tion (NGO) servicing the academe, the project involved two main programs - IBON’s Socio-economic Seminar and Philippine History Seminar. The IBON Socio-Economics Workbook and the IBON Teachers ’ Manual on Philippine History first served as seminar aids. But teachers later adopted these as sup- plementary material for their social-science classes. Getting the teachers in- volved in popular socio-economics under IBON’s guidance was crucial as they could reach out to the student population. From a simple databank with a twice-a-month publication, IBON has ex- panded its services in the field of popularizing socio-economics. These serv- ices and the needs served are further discussed below. DATABANKING AND RESEARCH FOR POPULAR EDUCATION 117",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/lNNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE The increasingly vigorous people’s movement in the Philippines in the 70s saw the effort of women activists to find their space in the movement. 128 PART I t :  EDUCATION AND INFORMATION MAKIBAKA (Malayang Kilusan ng Kababaihang Makabayan) was founded in 1970. Because of the declaration of Martial Law in 1972, it went under- ground, like other progressive organizations. As activists regained ground in the latter part of the decade, many women’s organizations either emerged for the first time, like the SAMAKANA, Center for Women’s Resources (CWR) and PILIPINA, or re-emerged, like KaBaPa. The Aquino assassination in 1983 spurred further the women’s movement opposed to the Marcos regime and saw WOMB (Women for the Ouster of Marcos and Boycott), WATCH and others marching in the streets representing the women’s voice. Filipino women, especially those involved simultaneously in the move- ment opposed to the Marcos regime and in the broader people’s movement for social transformation, were now looking for a Third World perspective on women’s liberation. The CWR took the initiative in 1984 to convene a consultation among women’s organizations, women’s desks of NGOs and women activists to dis- cuss a common women’s orientation in the Third World. An important resolu- tion of that consultation was the founding of a nationwide federation of wom- en’s organizations which became known as GABRIELA. Sr. Mary John Mananzan had been involved in the foundation of PILIPINA and Center for Women’s Resources and eventually became the chairperson of GABRIELA. She was at the same time Dean of College of St. Scholastica’s College. Since she had been conducting women’s awareness seminars in the different organizations she was involved in, she felt that the academe was definitely lagging behind, including St. Scholastica’s College which, ironi- cally, is a women’s college. She found it urgent that the 400 women that gradu- ated annually from the college should be given the opportunity of a basic women’s orientation. In the first semester of 1985, she invited members of GABRIELA and PILIPINA, as well as some of the women faculty members of St. Scholastica’s College, to a weekend seminar to create a syllabus for an Introductory Course for Women’s Studies. After three days of enthusiastic and intensive discus- sion, the group came up with a syllabus and each one committed herself to study a topic she was assigned to lecture on. A dry run was conducted the following month where each lecturer presented her paper to the group for critique and suggestions. In the second semester of 1985, a pilot class of juniors majoring in psy- chology was chosen. Since the lecturers wanted to listen to each other, each session had 18 teachers and 16 students! At the end of the semester an evalu- ation was made among the students and teachers. The evaluation was over- whelmingly positive although some recommendations were made regarding the content and methodology of the course. PIONEERING GENDER AWARENESS IN  THE ACADEME 129 According to a student, the content was not only a content course, but a perspective course, that is, it gave the students another perspective in looking at reality. Other students found the course needed an organizational compo- nent and this paved the way for a women’s organization in campus called S- KAIBA. Such a positive evaluation of the course eventually led to the decision to make it a requirement for graduation from St. Scholastica’s College. The course developed into a Women’s Studies Program that later on be- came the Institute of Women’s Studies, founded on the following goals: (a) to awaken a consciousness to and provide an understanding of the woman question through a strategy of formal (institutional) and non- institutional alternative education; (b) to engage in research and study on gender issues, and projects that uphold the cause of women; and (c) to conduct outreach programs that serve women outside the formal educational institution.

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE When the Other India Bookstore (OIB) was set up by the Third World Bookstore Society in 1988, it set itself the limited objective of establishing interactive links between the book trades of India and those of Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. The Society was set up by committed Indian intellectuals who felt it a scandal that nearly 50 years after independence, one still could not access books from Africa, South America or Asia. All the books one could get in the Indian market from publishers outside India were re- stricted to titles from publishing houses based in the UK or the USA. The dominance of the Western book trade naturally implied the domina- tion of intellectual culture as well and the continued influence of Western ideas - whether such ideas were appropriate or not - over activities carried out in different regions of the South. Either in various syllabi prescribed by 148 PART II: EDUCATION ANS INFORMATION the universities or through conditioned response, there remains even today a near-total dependency on the foreign, specifically English and North Ameri- can, written word. Even academic scholarship focused on or around the so- called “Third World” is dominated by the word as proclaimed from the West. The result of this dominance is that an author feels his/her work is recog- nised only if it is published in Europe or America, since those are the places where it gets recognition and from where its importance slowly filters down to other countries. When a book is published in the West, the so-called leading intellectual journals might review it, some colleges might prescribe it as rec- ommended reading for students, quotes from the book might appear in other publications and the author thus feels he is recognised as an intellectual, poet, novelist, scientist, etc. by those who matter. The dominance extends to marketing practices as well. More than 30 to 40 years after political independence, all the ex-colonies are still flooded with books, magazines, and journals from powerful Western publishers and their outlets. Ask in an Indian bookshop for books published in Sri Lanka, Paki- stan, Nigeria or Kenya and you will draw a blank. Ask in those countries for a book published in India and you will receive a similar negative response. But ask for a book published by Harper and Collins, USA or Oxford University Press, UK, and chances are that the title is readily available for sale. The domination of the book trade by Western publishing houses is so powerful that literature generated in countries of the South eventually find their way to other countries in the South only through the North. A good example is the African Book Collective in London which dominates and con- trols the flow of literature from Africa to the rest of the world. To read, for instance, the Kenyan writer, Ngugi wa Thiong’o’s outburst against his former rulers, in Decolonising the Mind, Indians had to first obtain it courtesy of a publishing house in London. Due to the stranglehold exercised by Western centres, African writers are unable to trade their work directly with their coun- terparts in other parts of the South. The same situation holds true for hundreds of other writers from the South. Efforts to change this wholly undesirable scenario have not borne much fruit, despite the emergence of “South-South’’ political institutions like the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), or, for that matter, a greater awareness than ever be- fore that the “world information order” is highly distorted as it tilts in favour of the countries of the West.

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE The Philippines’ long colonial history has to some extent contributed to the distancing of Filipinos from their indigenous value-systems, traditions, rituals, songs and dances. The prevalance of a highly-Westernised modern culture has prevented the development of a Filipino cultural identity based on the country’s rich indigenous heritage. The colonial period saw the development of theatre traditions which rein- forced existing hierarchies of social and political power. From religious dra- mas to popular variety shows, theatrical productions tended to reproduce domi- nant colonial stereotypes of Filipino identity. After independence, the country’s political and economic stability gradu- ally worsened into crisis. The Philippines was faced with huge foreign debt, rising inflation, widespread unemployment and the challenges of meeting the social development of a large and poor population. In this context, the need for a viable medium of articulation and expression, as an alternative to the mainstream media, grew stronger. Both art and information, however, were subject to strict scrutiny and censorship during the Marcos regime. Since the fall of the Marcos government in 1986, there has been an easing of restrictions on the media. It remains however, that the cultural scene con- 160 PART II: EDUCATION AND INFORMATION tinues to be dominated by a Westernized and commercialized culture that is not reflective of the Filipino people’s history, experiences, values and reali- ties. The people’s issues and concerns, their hopes, dreams and their aspira- tions need expression and a medium of expression. The Philippine Educa- tional Theater Association (PETA) addresses this need through the People’s Theater and the School for People’s Theater, which strives to educate the Fili- pino people about the richness of their heritage, and liberate them from the forces that threaten to erode that cultural wealth.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE The Philippine Signs, a bi-weekly newspaper and forerunner of Philip- pine News and Features (PNF), came out in 1984, during the time of the late Ferdinand Marcos’ martial law regime. ALTERNATIVE NEWS AGENCY AS AN INSTRUMENT OF SOCIAL CHANGE 179 The Philippine Signs contained news, features, analyses and commentar- ies about issues such as human rights violations, economic issues such as the country’s rising foreign debt to the World Bank and the International Mon- etary Fund, farmers’ demand for real agrarian reform, labor strikes, and cov- erage of the various levels of sectoral protests against Marcos’ rule. In a political climate which was not exactly conducive to press freedom, the Philippine Signs and a number of other “alternative” newspapers, along- side underground publications called the “mosquito press”, found readership among a public hungry for an alternative perspective to what emanated from the mainstream media. The alternative newspapers under Marcos went mainstream under the presi- dency of Corazon Aquino, who took over the reins of power following the former’s ouster in 1986. During Aquino’s presidency, other newspapers also emerged. At this point, the Philippine Signs, which was being published by a group led by socially critical church people, could not compete with the busi- ness-backed mainstream newspapers. The men and women behind the Philip- pine Signs thought of an alternative: set up a news agency which would come out with a regular dispatch of news, features, analyses and commentaries. The mainstream newspapers would be the news agency’s outlets. The news agency became known as Philippine News and Features or PNF, originally the pseudonym of a correspondent of the now defunct Philippine Signs. PNF immediately set itself a special mission: to help articulate, interpret, analyze and comment on the basic issues the mainstream media tend to gloss over. These issues include the continuing clamor for no-nonsense agrarian reform, environmental woes, and the various issues and advocacies marginalized sectors have since taken up. These sectors include landless peas- ants, laborers, indigenous peoples, women and children. While PNF recog- nizes that all these issues have existed since the time of the Marcos regime, it also acknowledges that the world situation has changed since 1986. PNF thus sees a new challenge: the eclipse of the bipolarized world. 1986 onwards saw the emergence of the current trend of ‘‘globalization’’, rapidly integrating national economies into a world economy. States are under pres- sure to “reform” their political institutions and social and economic policies to accord with globalization. However, citing worldwide evidence, PNF has seen that globalization, despite its claims of creating new wealth, is further driving a wedge between the few haves and the many have-nots among the world’s family of nations. The result: a rising economic imbalance among nations and within them. This spurs social tension. PNF warns that the human rights of peoples, communities and individuals might be trampled on, and their social and cultural values undermined, once these hamper globalization’s 180 PART II: E d U C A T I O N  AND INFORMATION drive toward “market efficiency” and “maximized profits”. The Philippines is not exempt from the harsh impacts of neo-liberal globalization. In this light, PNF sees its tasks (“to develop and raise social awareness and to foster change, human dignity and genuine development”) to have become more challenging than ever. PNF has to be attentive, for exam- ple, in monitoring new government policies embracing globalization designs. For instance, a mining law approved in 1995, has practically liberalized and opened up the country’s mining industry to foreign mining prospectors. The law has courted conflict. Many villagers in indigenous communities, where gold, copper, silver and other minerals are found, either have been displaced or are under threat of being forced out of their ancestral land. The liberaliza- tion of mining, bioprospecting and biopiracy, massive conversion of food- producing lands into real and industrial estates, the contractualization of labor, and the social conflicts spurred by these phenomena are among the impacts of globalization which PNF seeks to help address.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE In terms of budgetary allocation, education is given a low priority. From the 1980s through the early 1990s for instance, education received only 7.2% (or lower) of the total national budget. This allocation was not sufficient to cover the needs of the sector. This explains the chronic problems of lack of teachers, classrooms and other facilities throughout the country. The quality of education is also not satisfactory. In 1977, 97% of the students in the public THE EDUCATION FORUM EXPERIENCE IN ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION 193 elementary school grades were unable to develop sufficient skills in reading, writing and arithmetic. For every elementary graduate, it has been found that only two-thirds of what should be learned was actually comprehended and absorbed by the student (see Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports Re- port, 1977). These trends continue to manifest themselves up until today. The government also has a policy of privatization of secondary and terti- ary education resulted in its policy of privatization of these sectors. “As mon- etary gains motivate private education, its principle of social service is lost in the effort to minimize the cost of production in order to maximize profits” (Quejada, 1986:34). In 1972 for instance, the summed-up profit of eight big schools (Arellano, Centro Escolar University, Far Eastern University, FEATI, Manila Central University, MLQU, University of Manila and University of the East) was P8.28 million. In 1975, their profits increased to P14.66 million. This means that between 1972 and 1975, the profits of these institutions in- creased by 77%. As government involvement and subsidies progressively decreased and education for profit dominated the higher levels, many students were eco- nomically “selected off’ as they progressed up the ladder of educational at- tainment. In a study published by the Presidential Committee to Survey Phil- ippine Education (PCSPE) in 1970, it was found that out of 100 students en- tering grade one, 60 usually would be able to finish grade six; 40 would graduate in high school; and only 4 would finish college. In other words, the educa- tional system posted a mere 4% finishing rate. This trend persists today.",

    "abstract": "THE PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Within Third World countries, the basic needs of large sections of people (in some cases perhaps two-thirds of the population) have yet to be satisfied. In many countries, the numbers of people living below the poverty line have increased significantly, despite moderate rates of economic growth. The de- gree of income inequalities between income groups has also increased as growth fails to solve the basic-needs problems of the poor. Planners and poli- ticians often strive for a style of national development which imitates the models set up in industrialised countries and which have been widely recog- nised recently as environmentally unsustainable. Much in the name of devel- opment goes towards the creation and sustenance of artificially high lifestyles imported, with some minor modifications, from the West. This “transfer of taste” is not confined to the elites of the Third World, as high-powered advertising and aggressive sales campaigns by transnational corporations (TNCs) ensure that the imported consumer culture penetrates and permeates through every corner of the land. Through the impact of such promotions, the traditional lifestyles and cultures of the local people are trans- formed to foreign tastes that divert away valuable resources to wasteful and even dangerous consumption habits. Junk-food and fast-food culture at the expense of locally available and wholesome foods, bottle-feeding at the ex- pense of breastmilk, cigarettes, alcohol, cosmetics, disposable and throwa- way products etc. are all part and parcel of a wasteful and unsustainable life- style. The pattern of development has also resulted in environmental crises of startling proportions. The very basis of development and indeed human sur- vival itself has been undermined by environmental destruction and degrada- tion. It is this scenario of the present and future problems of the world that provides the background to the activities of the Consumers’ Association of 208 PART Ill: SOCIAL RIGHTS AND ADVOCACY Penang (CAP). Its objective is to awaken the consciousness of the people to the present style and rate of development which destroys the environment and produces things which are useless or harmful to health, without satisfying the basic needs of the majority of people. CAP believes that only when develop- ment serves the needs of people and not the other way around will real progress be achieved. For this to come about, the awareness of people must be awakened. As an organisation oriented towards consumer protection and social reform, CAP sees its role as bringing up important development issues and generating pub- lic consciousness on these issues. The CAP model, when it developed in the 1970s and 1980s, pioneered a new approach of consumer activities that were adapted to the needs of people and communities in developing countries. The consumer movement had origi- nated in the Western countries, where “Value for money” had been the slogan, and testing of products (to determine the relative performance of various brands) had been a major objective. CAP coined the slogan “Value for peo- ple” to symbolise that in the Third World context, the consumer movement should be oriented towards meeting the needs and articulating the rights of ordinary consumers, such as the right to food, housing, employment, a clean environment, safety in products, good business practices and an efficient bu- reaucracy.",

    "abstract": "In real life, it is not uncommon for the poor to experience difficulty in seeking legal redress. The Indonesian people are sometimes subjected to the high cost of court procedures, one-sided job termination,and other legal injus- tices. This imbalance is aggravated by unawareness of their rights in seeking justice. One irrefutable fact remains, that up to now most of Indonesian soci- ety, especially those living below the poverty line, are still legally illiterate. There have been thousands of instances where civilians’ rights had been infringed upon, from civil to criminal cases, from personal cases to those involving the society. Such injustices have opened the eyes of legal practi- tioners to the need to lend a hand to people needing legal services. In the beginning, legal assistance programs in a basic form appeared in law faculties with their consultation bureaus, and then there are private legal assistance organizations managed by certain groups. But those efforts are lim- ited to just providing legal advice and consultations, or limited to certain groups only. The Tjandra Naya legal aid organization, for example, only serves non- pribumis. In the meantime, people from the low-income group could hardly obtain access to legal aid, until a prominent legal practitioner, Adnan Buyung Nasution, was moved on seeing the plight and backwardness of those legally illiterate people. In his practice as an attorney in the courts, Buyung appre- hended the weak position of the accused in the court of law. They did not know their rights. Even if they did, economic poverty made them unable to do anything, including hiring a lawyer to get legal aid. With that realization upon him, Buyung strived to assist the illiterate, legally illiterate and very poor by giving free legal aid. In 1959-60, in his capacity as an attorney, Buyung had the chance to study at the University of Melbourne, Australia. During that time, with the help of the Colombo Plan Program Officer, he got the opportunity to observe the various forms and work conduct of legal aid offices in Australia. INDONESIAN LEGAL AID FOUNDATION 223 On returning from Australia, Buyung tried to realize his aspiration, but he had to give up due to the prevailing situation in the country. Under the decree of July 5 ,  1959, the legal aid efforts that he strived for did not materialize - not until the third congress of Persatuan Advocat Indonesia (Peradin)/Indone- sian Lawyers Association, when Buyung proposed the establishment of a le- gal aid foundation for the masses. As a result, a group of young lawyers from Peradin founded the Lembaga Bantuan Hukum (LBH)/Legal Aid Foundation in Jakarta on October 28, 1970, coinciding with the Youth Pledge day.",

    "abstract": "THE PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE The Philippines, and the Cordillera region in particular, is endowed with rich natural resources. It has vast mineral deposits, major rivers that can gen- erate hydropower and large timber reserves. In spite of the wealth of its land, the region remains relatively underdeveloped. The indigenous inhabitants of the Cordillera are collectively known as Igorots. The Cordillera was excluded from the economic, political and cul- tural development process of the colonial society because of their strong re- sistance against the Spanish. The resistance of the Igorots to the colonizers made them retain their indigenous lifestyles and institutions throughout the period of Spanish colonial rule. To denigrate those they could not conquer, the Spanish colonizers labeled the lgorots as savage, heathen and uncivilized. During the American colonial period, the Igorots were categorized as cul- tural minorities and were subjected to discrimination, for example, they were subjected to assimilationist policies. The traditional economy of some of the 234 PART Ill: SOCIAL RIGHTS AND ADVOCACY Igorots was eroded to shift production towards the market. The penetration of the cash economy into the region slowly destroyed the natural self-sufficient economy of the region. Environmentally sustainable agricultural practices of the Igorots were considered backward and unscientific. Agricultural produc- tion that generated cash crops like coffee, beans, vegetables and bananas was what was considered as a productive activity. The colonizers were also able to exploit the region’s natural resources through legislation which facilitated the entry of big corporations. From the American colonial period to the present, the Cordillera has been a resource base for business interests. This can be seen in the presence of mining companies, logging concessions, hydroelectric power plants and ex- port processing zones in the region. This has resulted in environmental prob- lems such as denudation of forests, river pollution and depletion of mineral resources. In spite of the fact that the region provides revenues to the national gov- ernment from the extraction of its natural resources, social services and ap- propriate development projects are very inadequate. This inadequacy is seen in the lack of good roads; poor communication facilities; inadequate, dilapi- dated schoolhouses with few teachers; insufficient and inappropriate health services; and the poverty of the indigenous peoples. Most of the women are found in the rural areas of the region, with an overwhelming majority engaged in subsistence agricultural production. In tra- ditional rice production, the women assume most of the major tasks, from seeding to seed selection. The erosion of the traditional economy in some areas has led to the displacement of women. Many outmigrated to the mining areas to join their miner husbands and to the urban poor communities in the city. Since subsistence production and women’s work are mainly for domes- tic purposes, these have not been considered as productive activities and factored into the gross national product. Outside of traditional agricultural production, a significant number of women are engaged in commercial farm- ing. As wage earners in the temperate vegetable-growing areas and rice-pro- ducing areas of the region, women are being paid less for their labor than men. A considerable number of women are also found in Baguio, the only ur- ban center in the region. Employment opportunities in Baguio and neighboring towns are found in the export processing zone, the mining areas, banks, tour- ism-related businesses like hotels and restaurants, government offices, pri- vate and public schools and hospitals. In the mining areas, the women are confined to their homes and have very limited livelihood opportunities. The mining companies do not hire women. Some miners’ wives have cultivated the sides of the mountains near the mines to supplement their husbands’ meager DEFENDING INDIGENOUS WOMEN’S RIGHTS 235 income. With the shift in mining strategy from underground mining to open-pit and bulk mining which requires less workers to operate, a large number of workers are being retrenched. Laid-off workers, along with their wives, are forced to leave the area to seek for new sources of livelihood. Small-scale mining, which employs not only men but also women in the area, is prohib- ited within the areas claimed by the big mining corporations. In the factories of the export processing zones, 80% of the workforce are women. Companies prefer hiring females to males because they believe that females are “more adapted to boring and dexterous assembly work” and can be hired cheaply. Working conditions are often unfavorable for the women. Some of these companies do not provide maternity benefits and in some cases, pregnancies meant the termination of employment. Gender discrimination is manifested not only in the economic realm, where women are paid less in wages, and in the political realm wherein decision- making processes are dominated by men, but also in the cultural arena. Patri- archy, which perpetuates the belief that women are subordinate to men, was reinforced by the colonizers’ culture, religion, education, economic and po- litical systems. The problems of gender discrimination are found in the social, economic, political and cultural realms. Marginal production, illiteracy, lack of social services, inappropriate development programs, domestic violence, violence from structural and institutional forces, and commodification beset the Cordillera women.",

    "abstract": "The Legal Rights and Resources Center or LRC was organized at a time when various advocacy groups had to redefine and redirect their focus and energy. The five lawyer-founders of LRC were trained under the civil-politi- cal rights movement, which championed human rights during the martial law reign of the late Ferdinand Marcos (1972-1986). After the Marcoses were ousted in a civilian-backed military uprising in February 1986, several advocacy groups, many of which came from the hu- man rights or civil-political rights movement during the Marcos years, sought other avenues for their advocacy. For its part, LRC chose to advocate and champion the socio-economic and ancestral land rights of indigenous peo- ples. To LRC, the country’s 17 million indigenous peoples (24% of the coun- try’s total 70-million population), who have long helped protect and conserve the country’s forest ecosystem and biodiversity, have to be attended to. De- spite their role in preserving and sustaining their environment, indigenous peoples have been marginalized, due to policies and laws which opened in- digenous peoples’ lands to loggers and big commercial miners. As a result of these laws and policies, only over six million hectares (ha.) of forest cover are left in the Philippines. Only 700,000 ha. are believed to be primary or largely untouched forest. Another 3.4 million ha. of secondary forest remain. These are forests which have been logged, generally once, but still have commercial potential. With the present rate of loss of the remaining primary forest, it is esti- mated that the biologically most diverse and economically most important INNOVATIVE POLICY ADVOCACY FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN THE PHILIPPINES 251 can be lost within the next decade. A more recent independent assessment concludes that the natural resource base of the Philippines has become so depleted and degraded that the country faces the grim prospect of a decline in its agri-based economy and the weak- ening of its democratic institutions. Its once magnificent dipterocarp forests have been ravaged, its rivers polluted with silt and sediment of eroded soils, its coral reefs ruined by blast fishing, and its mangrove forests decimated. Unless these pressing problems and the long-term threats to the resource base are addressed, the country will slide further into the pits of poverty and de- spair. To help make a difference, LRC has thus set its eyes on the lack of protec- tion of the terrestrial ecosystem, especially the remaining dipterocarp forest - the backbone of most terrestrial ecosystems in the country. The knowledge, potential and creativity of those individuals and communities directly depend- ent upon and living in these ecosystems were not harnessed. They are the indigenous peoples whom LRC opted to work for. When it finally began operations in February 1988, LRC aimed to focus on two main angles: (a) to help respond to actual crisis situations in indigenous communities; and (b) to try to change the “rules of the game” via policy advocacy. Having a battery of highly competent, committed and “people-oriented’’ lawyers, LRC had helped litigate indigenous peoples’ rights cases. But, as LRC’s experience has shown, indigenous peoples will be confronted with the same type of cases over and over again unless the rules are changed. LRC would realize later that policy advocacy does not only mean rules in black and white in the form of laws. Policy advocacy, rather, is a mix of other factors as well - political, institutional and financial (e.g., budget allocations). Although it is a legal group, which has the capacity to even propose legal technical language for proposed laws and policies, LRC has engaged in other forms of lobby work. This is because LRC may have the special skill in advo- cating and proposing rules and policies, but these become ineffective when they are not taken up.",

    "abstract": "In Benin, the soils of the southern plateaux have been under increasing pressure in recent years. As population density has increased, fallow periods have become too short to maintain soil productivity. The numerous smallholder farmers in the area have rarely used fertilizer and even when they have, the benefits have been reduced by a degraded soil resource base. One notable consequence of the reduced fallow periods has been the encroachment of Imperata cylindrica - an aggres- sive weed which requires substantial labour to eradicate by hand and which has forced farmers to abandon fields to fallow. In 1986-87, researchers with the development-oriented RAMR' (Applied On- Farm Research/Recherche Appliquee Milieu Reel project proposed alleviating low soil nutrient supply in the Adja Plateau in Mono province by cover cropping with mucuna (Mucuna pruriens). Farmers cooperating in the cover-cropping tests discovered an additional benefit of mucuna - its ability to smother and sup- press imperata. They found that use of the mucuna crop reduced the need for weeding or herbicide for subsequent crops of maize, which is the staple crop in the region. Tests on mucuna cropping were begun by other partners in the RAMR pro- ject, the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) of the Netherlands and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria. Researchers established the first small demonstration plots of mucuna in public places such as school grounds, so that the technology would not be completely unknown to farmers volunteer- ing to test it. Good contact between extension workers, researchers and farmers was the key dissemination strategy. Researchers lived in the small number of villages involved and were trained to listen to farmers. Farmers adopting mucuna cover cropping benefited from higher yields of maize with less labour for weeding. Many of the early adopters also earned additional revenue by selling mucuna seed as the technology was disseminated. Develop- ment organizations became interested in the farmers' adoption of mucuna: in The RAMR project is a farming systems research project of the national agricultural research service, INRAB. It is a collaborative activity of the DRA (Agronomy Research Directorate/Direction de la Recherche Agronomique) of the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), IlTA and KIT. 10 CHAPTER 1 / MUCUNA COVER CROPPING: BENIN 1990, the government extension services tested the system in 12 villages in Mono province and then extended these trials to other southern provinces in 199 1. Some non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as SG2000 (Sasakawa Global 2000), became involved in the diffusion of mucuna. In 1992, Sasakawa Global 2000 purchased about four tonnes of mucuna seeds from farmers benefiting from the RAMR project and distributed them to farmers facing spear grass invasion and/or soil depletion in every province of the country. The estimated number of Benin farmers testing mucuna grew to 3 000 in 1993 and nearly 100 000 in 1996. Some of the testing was undertaken in north- ern Benin, where land was not scarce. As a result, adoption was lower in those areas, although some farmers discovered that mucuna made good fodder for live- stock and, importantly, others observed that mucuna appears to reduce the most devastating parasitic weed of the savannah zone, Striga hermonthica. Two different management systems have been developed and recommended for the integration of mucuna into cropping systems. For severely degraded fields, a sole cover crop fallow is used. The plot is slashed before seeding mucuna and a second slashing may be necessary to allow the mucuna seedlings to overcome the fast-growing imperata. When the imperata infestation is not severe, a maize/mucuna relay is used: maize is planted at a normal spacing, followed by mucuna seeding either between or within the rows 40-45 days after planting the maize and just after the second weeding. The current adoption rate of mucuna in Benin is promising, especially in the south of the country, where there is an urgent need to destroy imperata and enhance soil fertility. A survey was conducted during the 1996 growing season of 142 farm- ers who were exposed to the technology over a period of five years. The results showed that 7 1 percent of the participating farmers used the technology for at least three consecutive years. Conclusions about the future viability of mucuna cover cropping may be drawn from an economic analysis based on some of the yield and adoption data. It indicated that positive returns are achieved at both farmer and regional levels in the second year after adopting mucuna. It is estimated that adoption of mucuna throughout Mono province would result in savings of about 6.5 million kg of nitrogen or about US$1.85 million per year. This innovative experience is one of the first instances of substantial adoption of cover cropping in West Africa, as we11 as one of the most important examples of a sustainable cropping-system development with farmers. It should be noted, however, that the conditions prevailing in the area, though right for adoption of mucuna cover crop fallows, may not be uniformly present in West Africa or even other parts of southern Benin. The critical circumstances surrounding adoption of mucuna cover cropping - a decline in soil fertility, lack of fertilizer, land SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH 11 scarcity and weed encroachment - combined to force farmers to adopt an agri- cultural innovation which might not otherwise have been accepted. A common reason for non-acceptance of mucuna is that it occupies land that could otherwise be used to grow a food crop. For this reason, there has been some testing of mucuna as human food, which has involved taking some Benin- ois farmers to Ghana, where small amounts are traditionally consumed. Mucuna beans require substantially more preparation than traditional beans to make them edible. Considerable testing of preparing mucuna for local dishes would thus be necessary to make it a feasible option for human consumption. One of the key lessons learned is that soil management techniques like cover cropping should have multiple benefits to be acceptable to farmers. It is helpful if one or more of these benefits is highly visible. In the case of mucuna cover cropping, the weed problem was often more obvious than the poor soil fertility and farmers could therefore better appreciate the impact of the new technology. It should be noted that even after mucuna cover cropping, imperata regains its original strength. This suggests that mucuna cover cropping alone is not enough to eradicate the weed. Destruction of imperata will therefore require an integrated approach, using cover crops combined with other management tech- niques such as tillage or herbicides. Furthermore, mucuna cover cropping may not be the best soil-management practice for all farmers. Other resource man- agement systems, based on cover crops or multipurpose trees, integrated with judicious use of fertilizers, may have to be developed elsewhere. Promising developments in soil management practices, however, continue to be made in Benin and neighbouring countries. To assist beneficiaries in decision making, a user-friendly database of 100 cover crop, grain and forage legumes has been established and shared with scientists from national agricultural research systems (NARs) in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, IITA in Ibadan, Nigeria, has established a clearing house of information and seeds of cover crops in West Africa (CIEPCA) to improve dissemination of knowledge on cover crops through- out the sub-region.",

    "abstract": "Conventional tillage methods, based mainly on the use of ploughs and disc harrows, are not sustainable - they destroy soil. Millions of hectares of agricultural land could be protected or saved from degradation and erosion, if farmers applied environmentally friendly tillage. Conventional tillage methods are a major cause of severe soil loss and desertification in many developing countries. Soil erosion, accelerated by wind and water, is responsible for around 40 percent of land degra- dation worldwide, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Tillage-induced erosion damages soil in most developing countries, where soil losses can exceed 150 tonnes per hectare annually. Parts of Latin America and Africa could become dust bowls if farmers do not change their tillage practices. Every time a farmer ploughs land to control weeds, soil life is destroyed and organic matter and water are lost. The soil structure is destroyed and it becomes more vulnerable to erosion. The use of tractors and heavy machinery acceler- ates this process and leads to soil compaction; the use of animals for ploughing and even hand hoeing also lead to soil degradation. The way soils are cultivat- ed today therefore needs to be drastically changed. In general, soils in tropical countries do not need to be tilled to provide an ideal habitat for plant growth - the best soils are usually “virgin soils”. The most desirable form of tillage is therefore not to till at all - zero tillage - leaving a protective blanket of leaves, stems and stalks from the previous crop on the surface. Zero tillage means dramatic savings of fuel, labour costs and time. In addition to zero tillage, there are other intermediate forms of reduced tillage systems that apply minimum soil tillage. These are called conservation tillage. Today, the concept of conservation tillage is being applied mainly in the Amer- icas. In North and South America, the area under zero tillage now totals 40 mil- lion hectares. Australia also has a strong conservation tillage movement. Using conservation tillage, farmers could for example reduce the production costs of soybeans per acre - by US$27 in Argentina, US$14 in the United States and US$l 1 in Brazil. Cost reduction is usually the most compelling reason for farmers to adopt conservation tillage. On the American continent, the area under zero tillage is growing exponentially. A country with a long history in this sector is Brazil, where progress has been facilitated by a strong partnership among government, industry, conservation organizations and innovative farmers.

    "abstract": "Water used in agriculture is traditionally considered waste that has to be dis- charged. Untreated, however, this polluted water threatens health and the envi- ronment. Conventional water treatment systems - highly specialized, costly and based on high inputs and energy - are beyond the means of most small- and medium-scale farmers in the developing world. As a result, water contaminated with sediments, pesticides, animal manure, fertilizers and other organic and inorganic matter is being dumped into streams, a practice which degrades water quality, limits its use downstream and causes a loss of valuable resources. In Colombia, as in other developing countries, traditional technologies for waste- water decontamination were restricted to expensive septic tanks or oxidation lagoons, in which organic matter, nutrients and energy present in wastes were lost and rarely linked to waste re-use such as irrigation, fertilization or aquaculture. There was therefore an urgent need to develop simple, low-cost and practical waste manage- ment techniques, adapted to tropical conditions and the resources available. An innovative example in Colombia has been the Productive Water Decon- tamination System, developed by the Centre for Research in Sustainable Sys- tems of Agricultural Production (CIPAV Foundation). The aim is to reduce water and soil pollution caused by agriculture and convert the energy and nutrients contained in wastewater, such as biogas, compost and fertilizer, into elements that can be used in farms. The system is based on the idea that organic waste treatment and recycling can be more effectively carried out through biological processes involving the activity of micro-organisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi, plants and animals. The elements of the system are a low-cost biodigester, which is easy to install and operate, and aquatic plant channels complemented by fish polyculture ponds and associated crops. Wastewater passes through the bio- digester and then to the aquatic plant channels and the fishpond. As wastewater passes through the system, pollutants are transformed into biogas, aquatic plant biomass, food crops and feed for fish. Aquatic plants are harvested and used periodically and the sediments accumulated in the bottom of channels are collected every four or six weeks to be used as fertilizer. 46 CHAPTER 1 1 PRODUCTIVE WATER DECONTAMINATION: COLOMBIA Since 1993, the system has been implemented in the Andean watersheds of the Valle del Cauca province of Colombia. Attention was focused primarily on tests at Los Sainos, a 150-hectare site in the upper portion of the watershed, where productive systems and households were polluting a stream used as a source of drinking water by most families in the area. Some inhabitants searched for water upstream in order to avoid the health problems caused by contaminated water. Conflicts between neighbours arose as unpolluted water became scarce and water transportation costs increased. Downstream, some people had to take water from different watersheds with less pollution. CIPAV worked with the landholders to diagnose the problems of water quality and access, analysing plant cover, agricultural and household activities and the size and distribution of human populations. Once the productive decontamination system was implemented, there was a notable recovery of the watershed, a reduction in pollution and generation of income for farmers. Wastewater from farms and domestic activities was treated as a valuable resource containing energy, organic matter and nutrients that had to be extracted before water was returned to the environment. Decontamination was soon considered a productive and attractive activity by farmers, since they could obtain aquatic plants to feed animals and fertilize plants as well as obtain fish and crops, both as food and saleable goods. Above all, they could obtain biogas for energy, which was less labour-intensive or costly than using scarce firewood. An important incentive for the implementation of biodigesters was the possibility of replacing up to 70 percent of diesel motor fuel with biogas. This allowed medium- and large-scale farms to generate electricity or move machinery within the production units or in the neighbourhood. As a result, farming units were more efficient in the use of resources and had lower production costs, as they were less dependent on external inputs such as firewood, fossil fuels, fertilizer and formulated feeds. Since the introduction of the system, landholders have become more aware of contamination and other adverse effects of agriculture on the environment and human health and the need to preserve and protect water as a natural resource. Streams have recovered their quality and can be used by more people. This means a lower incidence of water-related diseases and lower costs of water treatment for human consumption. The Productive Water Decontamination System has since been successfully used in other localities to treat different kinds of agricultural residual water. While the system was being introduced and developed at Los Sainos, it was also tested at various medium-sized and large productive systems in the flat lowlands of Valle del Cauca, where it proved equally effective and efficient. Currently, SHARING lNNOVATlVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE S O U T H  47 the system has been adopted by an estimated 37 percent of farms in the area, with the systems treating from between 70 to more than 30 000 litres of waste- water daily. Adoption of the CIPAV system to treat wastewater from agriculture has social, environmental and economic benefits. In 1995, the system and its participatory research process won the Planeta Azul (Blue Planet) Ecology Award and it has been introduced into various tropical countries including Costa Rica, Honduras, Venezuela and Viet Nam. It is hoped that other countries will follow the example. Installation of the system is easy and can be carried out without specialized skills. The polyethylene tube used for biodigesters is produced in most countries, while the other materials and fittings are commonly available in local markets.",

    "abstract": "The state of Jammu and Kashmir in the northwest of India is the country’s main walnut-producing zone: all the walnuts exported by India are produced in the state. Persian walnut (Juglans regia), covering about 63 000 ha of the region, is the most commercially important species, with an annual production of approx- imately 60 000 tonnes and a farm value of about 25 million Indian rupees . Since the entire walnut plantation is of seedling origin, however, there is con- siderable variation in nut crop production. The development of walnut cultivation has in addition faced a number of constraints, including: non-availability of plant material of known pedigree and characteristics an absence of proper classification of local varieties; a long gestation period and low tree density per hectare, resulting in low In order to reduce the gestation period, increase productivity and ensure uniform product quality, a two-phase project of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) - TCP/IND/4554/8221 (1996-98) - tested different methods of vegetative propagation of walnut under local agroclimatic condi- tions. The introduction and transfer of this propagation technology to the state represents a major contribution to the future development of walnut production in India as a whole. The objective of the first phase of the project was to establish the capacity of the Department of Horticulture of Jammu and Kashmir to produce high-quality yield, healthy walnut planting material for commercial distribution to producers. The second phase aimed to further strengthen and improve the results of out- standing walnut varieties and grafting techniques and train national technical staff and nursery workers. National and international personnel from Iran, Italy and Spain were involved. Activities started in February 1996, with the first visit of the international consultant/team leader, a specialist in walnut propagation and nursery manage- ment. An assessment of different walnut-growing areas of the state was conducted produced by vegetative propagation; productivity. At the time of writing, US$1= 42.5 rupees. 64 CHAPTER 1 /WALNUT PROPAGATION: INDIA and a detailed two-year work plan prepared. Locally selected genotypes were chosen as s c i o n  material, the prerequisite for any propagation programme, to train counterpart staff on the importance of specific pruning of walnuts to stimulate production of graft sticks for future multiplication and planting. A pre- liminary grafting trial was conducted, using a sample hot callusing cable unit. During the same year, land was designated by the state government for estab- lishing a walnut nursery and mother plant and progeny orchard at Zainpora farm in Shopian to produce the required number of graft sticks for future propagation. Three grafting techniques were introduced under the project at different points in time: hot callusing, chip budding and hypocotyl grafting. Hot callusing was demonstrated on three project sites and more than 50 persons were trained. A 65-70 percent success rate in vegetative propagation of walnuts was achieved by using hot callusing cable on the graft union. Chip budding achieved a 10 percent success rate; although the initial bud take was 70 percent, frost injury seems to have reduced the survival percentage. The hypocotyl grafting technique averaged around 50 percent in terms of final survival of the graft-take, despite certain limitations of a climatic and human nature. The hypocotyl technique is now being used to establish trials under the agroclimatic conditions of Jammu and Kashmir. To date, some 1 200 grafted walnut plants have been planted in the progeny and mother orchard of Zainpora farm. Of the 2 3 12 plants produced during the 1996-98 period, 661 have been planted in the progeny and mother plant orchard. In addition, 540 grafted plants of nine exotic varieties received under the project from FA0 have been planted in these two orchards. The establishment of the progeny orchard to obtain a greater number of graft sticks is expected to create conditions for mass production of grafted seedlings for large-scale nursery production. Training for technology transfer was an important component of project activities. For example, a nine-week study tour for three people was organized in Bulgaria, Italy and Spain to provide knowledge about the latest developments in the walnut industry through visits to advanced nurseries, walnut farms, walnut manufacturers and government research institutions involved in walnut study programmes. The project organized 38 weeks of fellowships for training local researchers in European research institutes, where they learned the funda- mental principles of propagation techniques, nut evaluation and computer skills. Several training sessions were arranged at Jammu, Ramban, Shalimar and Zainpora by the team leader. 29 Shoot of a plant, especially one cut for grafting or planting SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH 65 Information on project activities was disseminated during a one-day seminar in Srinagar, attended by more than 700 farmers. The preliminary results of this innovative project have been presented and discussed in various national and international meetings and workshops, with a final international workshop held at Srinagar in June 1998. During this latter event, everyone involved in the field project discussed their work and the results achieved and made recommenda- tions. The national project director’s membership of the International Plant Propagators Society provided an ideal opportunity to broadcast project results to a global audience and offers the potential for increased cooperation among scientists, nurserymen and farmers in future walnut production in Jammu and Kas hmir. The impact of the project is considerable and its achievements are expected to play a significant role in sustaining a large population living in the walnut- producing foothills of the state. The establishment of the mother and progeny orchard, the setting up of 35 hot callusing cable units and the introduction of advanced propagation technology hold great promise for improved walnut production.",

    "abstract": "Indonesia’s ultimate goal is to provide sufficient food to ensure all its citizens a varied and healthy diet rich in carbohydrates, protein, vitamins and minerals. Programmes for increased food production have therefore received top priority in the development of the agricultural sector as an integral part of national development. The broad strategy and policies for enhancing food output are aimed at: increasing farm accessibility and productivity; reducing risk in farming activities; developing modern farming practices and sustainable farming systems; increasing participation by farmers both in quality and numbers; enhancing equity in the distribution of income-earning opportunities and Implementation of the policies and programmes for increased food production is focused on four main efforts: intensification, expansion, diversification and rehabilitation of the nation’s agricultural infrastructure. Following independence in 1945, rice production in Indonesia lagged behind increasing domestic demand. This situation, coupled with the inability to expand production sufficiently, resulted in large-scale importation of grain and a serious drain on the economy. By the 1970s and early 1980s, Indonesia ranked among the world’s largest purchasers of rice, with imports peaking at two million tonnes in 1980. After 1979, the government applied new measures and techniques, particularly the introduction of high-yielding varieties of rice, appropriate fertilizers, agricultural machinery and the application of integrated pest man- agement (IPM), with the result that rice production rose considerably. By 1984, Indonesia had achieved self-sufficiency in rice. Between then and 1996, the total production of rice in the country was higher than total domestic consumption. Reaching this goal of rice self-sufficiency entailed meeting challenges that confront many developing countries striving to expand food pro- duction. Among the obstacles Indonesia faced were lack of arable farmland, the ravages of crop-destroying pests, technological and infrastructure shortcomings and poor financial support, education and training. It was clear that the country had to bring about major advances in the technology and capacities of its access to an adequate supply of food. SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH 75 agricultural system. This required fundamental changes in farmers’ attitudes and farming practices. An overriding challenge, therefore, was to motivate many millions of small farmers to participate actively in the national programme to increase rice production, since the focus on increasing output was from small farms rather than from large estates. The country’s success in attaining rice self-sufficiency has been made possible by several key factors. The Mass Guidance (BIMAS) Scheme - an integrated system designed to develop conditions where a large number of farmers can adopt new technology to increase their productivity and income - has been applied extensively. An integral part of BIMAS is organizing farmers into groups, which has proved an invaluable mechanism for disseminating information, technology, training and extension and implementation of new techniques. Attention has been paid to local rice varieties through exploration, collection, evaluation and the documentation of germplasm. Improved varieties providing higher yield and early maturity have allowed farmers to increase cropping intensity. The resistance of these varieties to pests and diseases has minimized the use of pesticides, thus reducing costs and protecting the environment. Since one of the characteristics of improved modern rice varieties is high response to fertilizer application, the government has regularly released national recom- mendations on fertilizer rates based on research findings. The government has also supported the establishment of fertilizer industries in several locations in the country to ensure steady supply and distribution. Another boost to increased agricultural production has been the greater availability and use of agricultural machinery such as tractors and hand sprayers, which have had a considerable impact. One of the most striking characteristics of Indonesia’s progress towards rice self-sufficiency, however, has been the introduction of integrated pest manage- ment. IPM uses resistant varieties, natural enemies, appropriate cultivation practices and planting times, sanitation and monitoring to ensure steady and sustainable production. Indonesia became the first country to adopt the IPM system as a national agricultural policy and apply it on a broad scale, promoted widely through extension and farmers’ field schools. The concept has since been adopted in other developing countries. These achievements in Indonesia’s rice programme have been complemented by development of institutions and structures at rural level to support produc- tion increases and establishment of an infrastructure to deliver farm outputs. The government has developed a favourable price policy for rice through setting floor and ceiling prices to protect farmers and consumers. In the years since the achievement of self-sufficiency, Indonesia has sustained 76 CHAPTER 1 / RICE SELF-SUFFICIENCY: INDONESIA rice production at levels capable of meeting domestic demand. A major contributor to the stabilization of self-sufficiency in this staple food has been the Super Intensification (SUPRA INSUS) system introduced in 1987, which has helped to boost rice production further, through its emphasis on enhanced cooperation among farmers’ groups. The innovative experience in Indonesia has demonstrated that self-sufficiency in rice can be achieved through a combination of interrelated factors: political will; a systems approach; continual technological efforts; a progressive rural structure; mass guidance; socio-economic engineering; These valuable lessons provide other developing countries with exemplary a well-coordinated programme. models in their drive for self-sufficient and sustainable rice production.",

    "abstract": "The first commercial oil palm estate in Malaysia was set up in 1917. Since then the industry in Malaysia has grown by leaps and bounds and the country is now the largest producer and exporter of palm oil in the world, accounting for 52 per- cent of world production and 64 percent of world exports in 1997. As in all industries, research and development (R&D) is critical, particularly since palm oil competes with 16 other oils and fats on the world market. There is a need to generate information, increase production and processing efficiency and expand uses of palm oil through R&D. The palm oil industry has been able to do this through the establishment of the Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (PORIM). PORIM, established by law in 1979, is funded mainly from a research cess (tax) imposed on palm oil millers, which brings in about 70 million ringitts3' each year. The Governing Board of PORIM, which includes representatives from the industry and the government, is advised on the research programmes of the institute by a Programme Advisory Committee, the members of which are experts in their own fields appointed by the Board. Various links, such as the PORIM-Industry Forum and PORIM-Industry committees have been established to ensure that R&D in PORIM is in line with industry needs and that research findings are disseminated to the industry and offered for commercialization. Since industry expectations are high, PORIM must be able to develop a strong and dedicated workforce to meet such expectations and an autonomous Board with full powers over remuneration, rewards and promotion is essential for attract- ing and retaining such a workforce. Although oil palm is native to Africa, Malaysia was the first country to embark on large-scale planting and processing. It had to develop its own technology and adopt innovative policies in order to boost production. Key elements of this policy were R&D through the establishment of PORIM and the levy of a cess on industry to defray R&D expenses. The PORIM approach is an innovative experience that could be replicated in other developing countries. 31 As at February 1999, 3 799 ringitts = US$l.

    "abstract": "Namibia is an arid country with one of the world’s harshest climates and very low agricultural potential. The country suffers from crippling and persistent drought and has limited irrigation water and irrigated land available. Large areas of the country are classified as desert environment, with climatic and soil condi- tions unsuited to crop production. Development under such conditions presents a formidable challenge. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, date palms have been growing in dry areas of Namibia next to riverbeds where groundwater is found close to the surface, a demonstration that the climate is suited to date palm propagation and production. Date palms are grown in five districts of the country where water quality and soil conditions are suitable. Although the date palm has the potential to foster agricultural development and improve the nutritional status of the population, several key factors have limited full-scale exploitation. Local technical knowledge was non-existent and dates were not produced for commercial purposes. The date fruit that was produced under natural conditions was locally consumed and no dates were channelled into any formal markets. Practices such as burning date palm leaves hampered fruit pro- duction and threatened the survival of palms. The existing date palms were not normally irrigated and survived only if their root system was within reach of groundwater. Date palms originated from seeds planted by settlers earlier in the twentieth century and no systematic selection was made of production charac- teristics of local female clones for further propagation. For some years, the Government of Namibia has set establishment of a date production industry high among its priorities. In 1993, a consultant from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) studied the tech- nical situation of date palm cultivation and investigated the potential for its expansion, with positive results. Although the government was unable to secure foreign funding for a subsequent project proposal, it nevertheless decided to fund the project out if its own resources. The basic aims of the project, the Date Production Support Programme, are to transfer to local Namibian experts and farmers knowledge about date palm propagation, production and protection and to support the establishment of SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 I AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH 99 commercial plantations in the country. The programme, which started in June 1995, supports and coordinates the activities of all components involved with date palm cultivation. Activities include: support for government-established plantations to prove the viability of date production in Namibia and serve as a nucleus for further development; support for private-sector entrepreneurs with potential evaluation, project planning and implementation; support for local date palm tissue culture laboratories to ensure the avail- ability of selected varieties at reasonable prices; training of Namibians through study tours and formal courses and an annual training course for farmers and technicians; establishment of a gene bank with the best selected varieties available; a local evaluation and selection programme for future multiplication; research on such key aspects as water requirements, pollination and inter- The immediate target beneficiaries are the government and private-sector date growers and settler farmers who produce, retail and export date products. Local date fruit consumers and the Muslim community in neighbouring countries also share considerable benefits resulting from the expected increase in dates available in the region. Among the notable achievements recorded so far has been control of deser- tification in various areas of the country resulting from the creation of date palm plantations, which has helped create microenvironments. Erosion by wind and water has decreased and soil fertility has increased. Countries in the subregion have expressed interest in date production and support for these countries has been provided by a Namibian team. Namibia has a real opportunity to compete on the international market in future as a major commercial date producer in the southern hemisphere. Since the country is out of season compared to all other major date producing countries, Namibia will be able to produce and supply dates to all major markets during the traditional off-season. The lack of major diseases and pests and the fact that no chemicals are used - the dates are natural/organic products - add value to Namibian dates. If Namibia is to target higher-priced markets in Europe and the Middle East, however, modern processing and packing facilities need to be established. Further recommendations to foster sustained growth of the industry include the estab- lishment of an International Date Palm Symposium and an International Date Information Network. Namibia’s newly established gene bank has been identi- fied as having value for other date-producing countries. cropping. 100 CHAPTER 1 / DATE PRODUCTION SUPPORT: NAMIBIA The innovative experience of planning, developing and implementing a crop production programme in one of the world’s harshest climates is an exemplary model for possible replication elsewhere. Palm cultivation has helped to improve nutritional status, generate income, diversify agricultural production and prevent/reverse desertification. It has made an important contribution to devel- opment of the drier western and southern regions of the country, allowing set- tlement of landless peasants and reducing the existing gap between communal and commercial farming. Such has been the success of the Date Production Support Programme that initial steps have already been taken to initiate a southern African regional project based on the Namibian experience.",

    "abstract": "Cotton occupies a unique position in Pakistan’s agrarian economy. Since the country has the potential to become a key player in global cotton and textile mar- kets, the government has been giving priority to research and development pro- grammes focusing on quantitative and qualitative improvements in cotton. Despite a notable increase in cotton production over the years, however, unsuitable picking methods, adulteration of seed cotton with water and foreign matter, mixed seed and mixed grades have reduced the quality of seed cotton. These factors, coupled with inappropriate ginning techniques, have downgraded the lint quality. According to one estimate, the country has been losing some 10-15 percent of the com- mercial value of its cotton. The core of the problem facing the country’s cotton industry has been the absence of a recognized and scientifically devised standardization system. The marketing and pricing system had been based on cotton varieties and weight, which resulted in a variety of grades and staples. The government therefore decided to introduce standardization and a pricing system based on premiums/discounts to bring Pakistan cotton on a par with internationally accepted standards and to ensure better returns for cotton growers, ginners, spin- ners and the national economy. In 1983-84, the government was assisted by the United Nations Develop- ment Programme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in setting up a cotton standardization system. The pro- ject lasted until 1986, by which time the foundation had been laid. The project upgraded facilities in ginneries and produced a core of trained graders, classers, arbitrators and instructors, who were able to evaluate and segregate seed cotton and lint both visually and instrumentally, according to the new standardization system. These trained personnel introduced standardization in 17 ginning factories in the 1984-85 cotton season and 33 in 1985-86. For the first time, Pakistan was able to export some of its production under standard grades, achieving a higher price than for ungraded cotton. Following these achievements, a Cotton Standards Institute project was 112 CHAPTER 1 / c o t t o nSTANDARDIZATION AND GRADING: PAKISTAN initiated in 1987 with technical and financial assistance from UNDP, FA0 and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The aims were to: establish a permanent institute and a cotton standardization programme based on an internationally acceptable grading and classing system; prepare grades and standards for seed cotton and lint; train new generations of graders, classers, arbitrators and instructors. By the end of the project in 1994, achievements in the cotton sector had earned Pakistan recognition both within and outside the country. First, the project established a national institute, the Pakistan Cotton Stan- dards Institute (PCSI), based in Karachi with two regional centres located in Punjab and Sindh provinces. PCSI is designed to implement the cotton stan- dardization and grading system at ginnery level, ensuring the supply of clean- ers and uniform raw cotton to the domestic textile industry. The objective is to raise the status and value of Pakistan’s raw cotton and yarn on the world mar- ket. The institute’s three sites have been equipped with classrooms, fibre-testing laboratories and lecture rooms, complete with modern technology. Second, the standards for seed cotton and lint cotton developed by the project were approved by the government in 1990 and declared the official standards for Pakistan cottons. These standards were recognized in 1991 by the Liverpool Cot- ton Association for conducting arbitration of Pakistan cotton. Another signifi- cant achievement was the design in 1992 of the colour chart for Pakistan cot- tons, which allows the country to evaluate its raw cotton on the High Volume Instrument (HVI) according to its own official standards. Some 180 cotton classers were trained and 19 female fibre-testing techni- cians were instructed in the operation of testing instruments. In collaboration with the Cotton Export Corporation, the project demonstrated the cotton standardization and grading system in several ginning factories, where the con- cept of grade premiums/discounts was implemented. Thanks to the standardization system and segregation of some better cotton types in selected ginneries, Pakistan cottons are now quoted in the Cotlook Price Index A. Previously, they had been quoted only in Index B, which gives a price five to seven US cents per pound less than the A index. During the project, the Cotton Export Corporation earnedh premium of US$19.45 million on the export of 2.33 million bales of higher-grade cotton, demonstrating the financial bene- fits obtained by switching to the standardization and grading system. The introduction of cotton standards and grading and the provision of premiums/discounts for various grades are part of an ongoing programme to develop the whole cotton marketing and pricing system in Pakistan. The enactment of the Cotton Standardization Bill will give legal status to the establishment and SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH 113 activities of the institute. The Karachi Cotton Association, a representative body of private-sector raw cotton exporters responsible for issuing daily spot rates for raw cotton, has agreed to switch to pricing of raw cotton on a grade and staple basis, rather than on varieties. Private-sector ginners, exporters and spinners have expressed interest in having personnel trained by the institute in cotton grading/classing . The innovative experience in Pakistan has improved cotton handling. The country is now able to compete with the best cotton fibres in the world, an achieve- ment that took just over ten years. The introduction of the standardization and grading system has demonstrated that proper marketing and quality control measures and a pricing system based on premiums and discounts increase the quality and value of the commodity. It shows that such a system motivates all parties, growers, ginners, spinners and exporters, to collaborate to meet con- sumer demand and compete in the global marketplace. There is scope for this example to be replicated in the cotton industries of other countries, including newly independent states in Central Asia. An oppor- tunity exists for the transfer of expertise from the PCSI into the cotton indus- tries in countries adjacent to the Aral Sea. Pakistan is an important cotton and yarn producing country, with the potential to become a key force in the global cotton and textile market. To achieve this goal, the country has to improve cotton marketing and quality control. There is growing realization that the challenges of the new world trade order and the IS0 90003' system demand a positive and quick response to the demands of world markets. The bulk of cotton produced in Pakistan has a fibre length of above 2.6 cm. From this material, 30-40 counts of yarn can be manufactured. According to estimates, however, this cotton has a high impurity content and high counts of foreign matter, trash and water. It is consequently regarded as poor by interna- tional standards. The impurities reduce the beneficial effect of the improvement in cultivars, impairing the quality of raw cotton and the rating of yarn and fabric, a cause of imperfect dyeing. The low quality of yarn produced in the country relates to unevenness, shading and contamination, defects that prevent manufacture of a final product with high value added. 33 IS0 9000 is an international quality standard that helps businesses define and document their 34 Counts are a means of qualifying the type of yarn produced. own quality procedures for production and/or services. 114 CHAPTER 1 / COTTON STANDARDIZATION AND GRADING: PAKISTAN According to the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in a study on the Textile Development Programme (1992): “The problems relating to the quality of raw cotton represent important obstacles to the development of the textile industry in Pakistan. Even if various improvements in the textile pro- cessing industries are undertaken, it may be difficult to effect an upgrading of Pakistan’s textile products if the quality of raw cotton remains as it is now.” A further assessment revealed that malpractices during marketing and the absence of quality-control measures or any recognized standardization system had led to a 10-15 percent loss in the value of raw cotton and manufactured goods, result- ing in huge losses to the economy. This may be attributed to the traditional seed cotton marketing system, where the main emphasis is on weight and variety. Disregard for quality, such as lower trash and moisture content, is attributable to the lack of incentives for producing clean picked seed cotton and good qual- ity lint. Lack of quality control is the main deficiency of the cotton marketing system. The Government of Pakistan recognized the need for quality considerations in the marketing system and has introduced a cotton grading system. The objec- tive is to improve the competitiveness of Pakistan’s raw cotton and yarn in order to ensure better returns for cotton growers, ginners, textile mills and the nation- al economy. The newly introduced system includes the grading of seed cotton and the classification of the resulting lint. An independent organization, the Pak- istan Cotton Standards Institute, has been established with assistance from the Asian Development Bank, FA0 and UNDP. The institute has trained personnel and is well equipped with sophisticated laboratory instruments to grade and clas- sify cotton. The main thrust is to revamp cotton marketing by emphasizing qual- ity in assessing the value of raw cotton. Ginners have in general been unable to provide farmers with incentives to supply dry and clean picked cotton, because they themselves receive no premium for producing good-quality lint. The cotton grading system is not intended to apply only to exportable surplus. Quality cotton may be interpreted differently by different spinners but some factors are standard requirements, such as being contamination-free, stickiness-free, well ginned and with an even running lot. The cotton standard- ization and grading programme gives great assistance to the textile industry by providing clean, uniform cotton. The problem faced by spinners is to procure cotton of standard quality required to spin a certain count of yarn with good results. In selected ginneries, the grading system has shown that it helps reduce contamination and variations within bales, from bale to bale and from lot to lot. This in turn leads to cost savings and improved processing efficiency, dyeing and finishing. SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH 115",

    "abstract": "Economic growth in rural communities in the developing world depends on reliable access to savings and credit; rural financial institutions (RFIs) dealing in small transactions need to be developed to offer a cost-effective service for rural com- munities. In the past decade, advances in computer technology and banking soft- ware and falling hardware prices have had a significant impact on rural banks, which can now be computerized with stand-alone microcomputer systems that make them efficient, customer-friendly and financially viable. In the Philippines, rural banks were characterized by slow, repetitive and ineffi- cient administration. Staff time was spent on manually kept account ledgers and interest calculations. Single transactions involved several processes, leading to inefficient customer service, inaccurate and out-of-date information and unsound management decisions. In September 1987, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) initiated the FA0 MicroBanking System, known as MicroBanker, in the Philippines, with the aim of enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in RFIs dealing with small transactions. The low-cost software was designed to run on personal computer (PC) equipment, initially to process savings accounts, time deposits and loan accounts. Modules were subsequently added covering current accounts, general ledger and customer information. The focus is on reduc- ing costs through improved staff performance in small banks. MicroBanker 's biggest advantage is flexibility: it can cater for a single teller installation or up to ten teller windows in the same office. It is a front-office system, so data can be entered at the time of the transaction. Such an automated banking system helps management maintain and supervise business by providing up-to-date information on portfolios and operations. The system was initially installed in a pilot rural bank, where costs were quickly reduced, operations were rationalized and customer services improved. Interest in the system grew rapidly. The Rural Bankers Association of the Philip- pines (RBAP), assisted by the Central Bank, endorsed it and established a sup- port facility to install and service the software. Shortly afterwards, growing demand led to the establishment of a private company, MB Philippines Inc., which installs and supports the system for clients in and outside the Philippines. 142 CHAPTER 1 I MICROBANKING: THE PHILIPPINES Microbanking has been established in the Philippines for a decade: in mid- 1999, there were approximately 800 independent and privately owned rural banks in the country, of which over 400 had adopted the system. These banks have paid the full cost of computer hardware, data capture and installation services and are now reaping the benefits of computerized accounts administration. Advances made with microbanking software have given RFIs a sense of competitive advantage, despite their small size, and facilities for better decision-making and control. Implementation, undertaken in clearly defined stages, lasts from a fortnight for small banks to more than three months for larger institutions. One of the lessons of the experience, however, is that successful implementation of microbank- ing requires strong commitment and involvement by senior management, who must persuade and motivate their employees. The innovative experience of microbanking in the Philippines has served as a model for other countries in Asia, Africa, Central and Latin America, the Caribbean, Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. The system is currently installed in over 1 200 sites in about 30 countries and numbers are steadily grow- i n g .  International organizations and donor agencies have collaborated in pro- moting adoption of the system. Earlier installations in Asia were tailored to meet the needs of individual insti- tutions. In 1994, FA0 introduced a standard runtime version of the system with software suitable for a range of needs. Work on improving the basic software has continued since then in order to improve effectiveness and broaden outreach in the developing world. These advances and formation of private-sector com- panies providing specialized support promise to play a crucial role in improving banking services for low-income people throughout the developing world. Con- version to a Windows operating system started in late 1998 in a joint venture with the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ). The new product is expected to be ready for marketing in early 200 1.",

    "abstract": "The Women in Business Foundation (WIBF) is a non-governmental organiza- tion (NGO) that aims to encourage and support the involvement of women in small business initiatives. Follow-up is provided for WIBF programmes by the Ofaga o Tomai Training Team, funded by the New Zealand Overseas Develop- ment Administration (NZODA) and managed by WIBF. WIBF and Ofaga o Tomai have collaborated to address the needs of village- level enterprises. The programmes developed by WIBF focus on utilizing village resources. The Ofaga o Tomai team develops the programmes and provides follow- up training and support. Ofaga trainers are skilled in many areas of traditional craft, small business management and microcredit. In 1996, New Zealand Agriculture Consultants Ltd. (NZAC) requested WIBF to write an appendix to the Apiculture Development Strategy for Western Samoa (TCP/SAM/455 l), being prepared in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The outcome was a number of initial training initiatives where staff of WIBF answered questions about small busi- ness. The relationship flourished in 1997, when WIBF, NZAC and the Pacific Islands Investment Development Scheme implemented an advisory mission entitled Beekeeping as a Small Business Initiative. Training took place in the villages of Saleimoa on Upolu and Faletagaloa- Safune on Savaii, covering basic beekeeping, potential products related to bee- keeping, empowerment, microcredit and small businesses. Some 20 people, mostly village women, were encouraged to learn through lectures and extensive hands-on experience. Samoans, who are afraid of bees and consider them pests, were fearful at the beginning of the process. Through contact with the bees and the beekeeping process, this programme has dispelled the myth, at least for those who took part, that bees are dangerous. The unique combination of training subjects has resulted in the setting up of businesses related to beekeeping and inspired women to try other business ideas. Partnerships have been formed between the Samoan Ministry of Agriculture, WIBF, the Samoa Beekeepers Association and FA0 to promote beekeeping as a viable rural industry.

    "abstract": "Maize is adaptable, high-yielding and fast-growing. These characteristics make it suitable for wider production and use in the developing world. Thailand has achieved considerable success growing maize as an alternative to rice, demonstrating that the young cobs, or baby corn, can be used as a nutritious vegetable and an export crop. Baby corn development in Thailand began in 1976 with the open-pollinated variety (OPV), followed in subsequent years by hybrids developed by both private and public sectors. In the past two decades, baby corn production has proved a remarkable success for farmers and the nation as a whole and has lessons for replication elsewhere. Baby corn is the ear of maize plant (Zea mays L.) harvested young, espe- cially before or just after the s i l k s  have emerged and no fertilization has taken place, depending on the cultivar. The de-husked ears can be eaten as a vegetable, whose delicate flavour and crispiness are much in demand in Thailand and abroad. Baby corn is free from pesticide and its nutritional value is comparable to cau- liflower, cabbage, tomato, eggplant and cucumber. Its by-products, such as tas- sel, young husk, silk and green stalk, provide good cattle feed. Cattle manure can then be used, enabling organic recycling through the plant-animal chain. Baby corn provides benefits to people from every walk of life. Farmers can grow four crops a year and production of baby corn generates employment among the rural poor of all ages. Brokers who buy from farmers, canneries, wholesale and retail merchants in Bangkok and exporters have already benefited from the crop in Thailand. Baby corn for domestic and foreign consumption has become a significant contributor to the Thai economy. Thailand is today a world leader in the export of canned and fresh baby corn. In 1974, Thailand exported only 67 tonnes, worth 800 000 baht (US$38 095); by 1997, exports had risen to 59 585 tonnes, worth 1 598.4 million baht (US$63.9 million), as shown in Table 1. Between 1988 and 1995, average quantity and value for export of fresh baby corn were 2 150 tonnes and 43.44 million baht (US$1.74 million), as shown in Table 2. 47 The silk-like filiform styles of unripe maize.

Development of baby corn as a nutritious crop for domestic and foreign use is an innovative example to other countries. Twenty years ago, people in Thai- land and other developing countries considered maize and baby corn as grain for the poor or animal feed, rather than a vegetable for human consumption. Through a well-publicized research and development programme and training initiatives, Thai farmers and consumers were encouraged to sample baby corn and participate in production, preparation and use. Domestic markets for baby corn are continuing to grow and the number of farmers producing the crop is increasing. The key to progress has been cooperation by the Thai government and involve- ment of researchers from the public and private sectors in an integrated approach. International agencies have provided breeding materials, support for research and human resources, making sustained development possible. 162 CHAPTER 1 / BABY CORN DEVELOPMENT: THAILAND TABLE 2 Quantity and value of Thailand’s exports of fresh baby corn, 1988-95 Year Quantity (tonnes) Value (million baht) 38 6 1988 2 220 1989 1476 33 4 ~ ~ ~ ~ - ~ _ _ _  _ _ _ ~ ~ ~ - ________ ___________ 1990 1 785 43 5 41 1 1991 1992 1929 47 9 _ _______ 1666 - ___-__ US$ 1 = Baht 25 Source: Department of Export Promotion, Ministry of Commerce Extension at all levels has been essential.

    "abstract": "Viet Nam has approximately two million hectares (ha) of acid sulphate soils, a large proportion of which are in the Red River Delta in the north and the Mekong Delta in the south. These soils need to be reclaimed for agricultural production, since toxic elements such as aluminium and iron accumulate in crop roots, harm- ing growth and ultimately yield. Rice is especially sensitive to toxicity soon after transplanting and at the flower- ing stage. To counter the toxicity inherent in acid and acid sulphate soils, there has been large-scale land reclamation in the Red River and Mekong deltas through water management measures and special agriculture practices. In 1989-94, a soil reclamation initiative took place in the Red River Delta under Water Management in Cau Qui Ninh - Pilot Polder, a joint project of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Food and Agricul- ture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Project activities were imple- mented in a 26.7 ha experimental area in Quynh Phu district in Thai Binh province, where land levels are about 0.7-1 .O m above sea level and there are three main soil types: acid, potential acid sulphate and actual acid sulphate. Prior to the project, about 60 percent of acid sulphate soils in the province were under cultivation but crop yield was low. Waterlogged conditions, high acidity, low nutrients and aluminium, iron and sulphate concentrations up to toxic levels had reduced crop yields. A combination of soil characteristics, water management and climate conditions meant that rice yields on acid sulphate soils in fields of Cau Qui Ninh villages were an estimated 30-35 percent less than rice grown on good alluvial soils. No subsidiary third crop could be grown between the two rice crops. Traditional irrigation and drainage canals had been constructed on fields but farmers had no experience of suitable water management to support the systems. The project constructed five subsurface drainage systems in the experimental area - clay pipe, sandy trenches, fascine,  open field ditches and mole drain systems - and water management was introduced as planned. Technical guidance was pro- vided to farmers, which helped them understand the techniques of irrigation and drainage for rice and maize, especially on deep drainage, for application on other fields. One of the most stnking lessons the farmers learned was that different drainage SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH 171 conditions result in different percolation rates. It was demonstrated that percolation rates in the centres of subsurface drainage plots were 3-6.5 mm/day, but 2.0 mm/day in the surface drainage plots, which is why there are more washed and leached toxic elements in subsurface than in surface drainage plots. In particular, subsurface drainage plots withdrew water very quickly after harvesting the sum- mer crop for growing the secondary crop in time. Before this experience, rice yield was only 6.1-6.9 tonnes/ha/year. Some rice crops even lost harvesting and no subsidiary crop could be grown between the two rice crops. After the experience, acid sulphate soils were improved, rice yield increased to 8.5-9.4 tonnes/ha/year and the third crop was introduced. In addition, the maize crop yielded 2.6-3.2 tonnes/ha/year. This was the first time that Thai Binh province had been able to introduce the subsidiary crop between the two rice crops on acid sulphate soils. The impact of applying subsurface drainage with appropriate water manage- ment was clearly positive but cost is a major consideration in applying subsurface drainage for reclamation of acid sulphate soils. Constructing a subsurface drainage system by clay pipe, fascine and sandy trenches proved expensive and compli- cated. The large experimental area was built instead with the open canal and mole drain at a cost nearly one quarter that of building the clay pipe, fascine and sandy trench drain systems. The project concluded that mole drainage and open canal were acceptable to farmers and likely to be replicated.",

    "abstract": "Smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe suffer from low incomes and living standards, poor nutrition, housing and health and are unable to send children to school. They are extremely food insecure, particularly in low rainfall areas, where rain- fed agriculture is almost always a failure. Irrigation, however, can make agri- culture successful, as had been recognized by 1932, when the government set up the Mutema irrigation scheme in Manicaland. Sixty years later, during the devastating drought of 1992, the Hama Mavhaire Irrigation Scheme was commissioned, affecting 96 families each with 1 ha of land. Built for slightly less than US$l million, the Hama Mavhaire dam was filled in one go by a flash flood. The surrounding area was completely dry but the irrigation scheme was a green oasis of life, visible for miles. The only maize of the year grew here and was followed by crops of beans and other vegetables. The scheme was a hive of commercial activity. People from surrounding com- munal lands and towns visited the scheme to order green mealies, grain and veg- etables. Orders for farm produce were received from as far afield as Bulawayo and Hwange, 250 and 500 km away respectively. Implementation involved planning with farmers. An interim Irrigation Man- agement Committee (IMC) formed at the outset enabled farmers and planners to share their views. Technology options were discussed and selections made. Unskilled labour for the surveys was recruited among potential beneficiaries. This enabled farmers to understand the technical aspects of the scheme, which would help them with subsequent management. Farmers were allocated plots prior to implementation and it was their respon- sibility to dig pipe trenches, clear bush and fence the scheme. Field equipment, provided initially through a government grant, belonged to the irrigators, who operated, maintained and if necessary replaced it. Management created a sense of responsibility and ownership and farmers now run a sustainable scheme, aver- aging US$2 000 a year each. Plot allocation took into account households headed by women, who participated in the scheme as equals to men. Environmental issues were prominent in scheme implementation.

    "abstract": "Bangladesh is considered one of the most suitable countries in the world for aquaculture, because of its favourable agroclimatic conditions. Development of aquaculture has generated considerable employment through the production and marketing of fish and fish seed. The revolution in water/aquaculture-based food production systems (the so- called “blue revolution”) in Bangladesh has achieved a 50 percent increase in aquaculture production, mainly as a result of new semi-intensive technology using locally available feed ingredients and other inputs. The Food and Agri- culture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been helping the govern- ment to develop and test this technology in different agroclimatic regions of the country. Householders have at least doubled their income from raising carp and other fish in traditional backyard pools. This achievement has been facilitated through innovations in extension. The experience described here involves an approach developed to disseminate new technology on a mass scale. An FA0 pilot project, Strengthening Rural Pond Fish Culture Extension Services, taught the new semi-intensive, low-cost methods to selected farmers, who in return trained other fish farmers at no cost - a “trickle-down’’ extension approach. This 1994-96 project markedly improved rural pond-fish culture extension services throughout Bangladesh and the gov- ernment has now used the project as a model for a low-cost countrywide exten- sion service. Before the introduction of the system, the lack of concerted extension activ- ities had hampered development and prevented fish farmers from realizing the full potential of their ponds. The major constraints affecting the spread and improvement of aquaculture had been: inadequate supply of seed cultures of species at the village level; absence of appropriate technology packages; poor distribution of technical information in rural areas; insufficient resources; lack of understanding about the dynamics of pond production. 228 CHAPTER 3 /AQUACULTURE EXTENSION THROUGH TRICKLE-DOWN: BANGLAOESH The trickle-down extension system is a participatory approach, designed to disseminate appropriate technology through method and result demonstrations. Details are given later in this paper. Several factors are fundamental to the success of the trickle-down system. Good working relationships should be established among all parties and appro- priate training organized for extension staff and fish farmers. The technologies for transfer must be consonant with local conditions and any required inputs should be readily available. There should be a requisite number of field staff at the thana (subdistrict) level, transport facilities and an effective supervision and monitoring system. Social recognition should be awarded to result demonstra- tors for their services. The work of the result demonstrators and fellow farmers has generated enthu- siasm and initiative in the aquaculture sector. A reporting mechanism provided regular information on activities and progress, training, problems encountered, pond/home visits and other work undertaken by extension staff. Extension train- ing materials, computer software, audiocassettes and videos were developed by the project for dissemination of the trickle-down approach. The technology and methods for technology transfer were found to reinforce each other. The demonstration of semi-intensive aquaculture in rural ponds showed that pond-fish production can easily be increased three- to fourfold by replacing traditional aquaculture practices with appropriate low-cost technology. For example, the final results from 701 demonstration ponds indicated that average pond production increased to 4 104 tonnes/ha/year from the previous average production level of 1 461 tonnes/ha/year. Inspired by the large-scale implementation of the aquaculture extension initiatives in rural ponds through the trickle-down system, the Government of Bangladesh has begun a national follow-up project covering 400 thanas. The government is using its own resources and closely following the example of the FA0 project. Undrainable rural ponds in Bangladesh are closely associated with socio- economic and cultural life and offer considerable scope for fish culture. Since almost all the ponds in Bangladesh are household ponds where women are close- ly involved, a project could be designed for the development of rural women through pond-fish culture. Organizing large-scale demonstrations in farmers’ ponds, without giving input/credit support and within the limited time of one year, was possible mainly because of the highest level of government support and involvement by counterpart officers and farmers. It was noted that fish farmers, 58 Result demonstrators are selected farmers who demonstrate to other members of their com- munity the results they have achieved in growth, size and health of their fish crops and overall yield and income. They also demonstrate the technological steps employed in fish breeding.

    "abstract": "Fish is an important source of food and income to many people in the develop- ing world. In Africa, some 5 percent of the population, about 35 million people, depend wholly or partly on the fisheries sector, mostly artisanal fisheries, for their livelihood. Various traditional methods are employed to preserve and process fish for consumption and storage. These include smoking, drying, salting, frying and fermenting and various combinations of these. In Ghana, smoking is the most widely practised method: practically all species of fish available in the country can be smoked and it has been estimated that 70-80 percent of the domestic marine and freshwater catch is consumed in smoked form. The advantages of smoking fish are manifold. Fish smoking prolongs shelf life, enhances flavour and increases utilization in soups and sauces. It reduces waste at times of bumper catches and permits storage for the lean season. It increases protein availability to people throughout the year and makes fish easier to pack, transport and market. Fish smoking in Ghana is traditionally carried out by women in coastal towns and villages, along river banks and on the shores of Lake Volta. In most fishing communities, in fact, the main economic activity of women is fish processing. Depending on the type of fish to be smoked, its uses and possible storage period, the smoking process can take the form of “wet” hot smoking or “dry” hot smoking. Both processes are carried out at temperatures above 80°C, which are high enough to cook the fish. Until the end of the 1960s, the ovens most used for smoking fish in Ghana were cylindrical or rectangular and made of mud or metal. Using these ovens had considerable disadvantages, however, such as excessive handling of fish during smoking, a problem more severe when smoking small species of fish such as anchovies. The ovens had a low capacity, were inefficient in fuel usage and could not cope with the large volumes of fresh fish landed during bumper fish seasons. This contributed to high post-harvest losses and, since the fish season also coincided with the rainy season, the fish could not be sun-dried. Because traditional ovens were inefficient, more firewood than necessary was used for the smoking process, which contributed to forest depletion. The SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH 241 health of the women fish smokers was at risk, because the smoke entered their eyes and lungs, they burned their fingers and they were exposed to direct heat. The fish smoking procedure was very laborious and poor-quality smoked fish was produced. In the early 1950s, awareness of the shortcomings of traditional ovens had stimulated development work on new and improved smoking ovens, such as the Adjetey, Altona, Ivory Coast and Nyegesi models. For various reasons, however, none of these was accepted when introduced in Ghana. In the light of lessons learned from the constraints and disadvantages asso- ciated with these earlier ovens, an improved traditional fish smoking oven, the Chorkor, was developed and introduced in 1969. This innovative model, devel- oped by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Food Research Institute of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Ghana, has since demonstrated the potential of traditional technolo- gies in meeting current challenges. The Chorkor oven, named after a small fishing hamlet on the outskirts of Accra, has numerous advantages. It is cheap to make and can be assembled using locally available materials. Easy to use, with large capacity, low firewood con- sumption and shorter smoking times, it produces high-quality smoked fish. This simple, highly effective fish smoking technology was popularized in Ghana through a number of training programmes and promoted using the par- ticipatory approach. Fish processors were involved from the outset in the imple- mentation process, thus ensuring high acceptance and adoption rates. In each community, fish smokers were informed of the benefits of the Chorkor smoker and ten of them engaged in year-long fish smoking were chosen in each com- munity. At least one mason and one carpenter were trained in each community to be responsible for the construction of additional ovens. As part of extension activities, a user manual was produced in English and French and a video cassette with an explanation of construction and use was produced for fish smokers, exten- sion agents and students. The innovation of the Chorkor oven has led to enhanced incomes, living stan- dards and nutritional status in fishing communities in Ghana. Its success has encouraged younger women to take up fish smoking as a profession and led to integrated programmes resulting in further socio-economic and community devel- opment in rural areas. Although initially developed for use in Ghana, the Chorkor oven has now received wide acceptance in most western, central and eastern African countries through a number of initiatives supported by multilateral and bilateral sources.

    "abstract": "Turkey’s forest communities, estimated at over ten million people, are one of the country’s lowest income groups. For these communities, the most important economic benefit from the forest is fuelwood, used for cooking, heating, laundering and house construction. Excessive and often destructive extraction of wood by these communities is, however, an obstacle to conservation and sustainable management of this valu- able resource. It has often led to conflict with the Ministry of Forestry, whose mandate is to manage forests sustainably. The Ministry of Forestry has tried to establish productive forest cover through reforestation in degraded forest lands and openings in forest areas but villagers use these areas as grazing land and have prevented reforestation of several million hectares. The recent increase in migration from forest to urban areas has reduced dependence on forests and pres- sure on forest resources but it has placed strains on separated families and increased the workload of women in forest communities. This report outlines the situation of rural communities, especially the women, living in the forested areas of Turkey and describes their activities in communi- ty forestry, including access to resources and services, participation, constraints and potential. To guide community development in forest areas and promote sustainable use of resources, externally assisted projects have been carried out in recent decades to develop community forestry and participatory methods for the coun- try. Since the late 1980s, concepts of “social forestry” and “community forestry” have been discussed and community forestry projects have been implemented. A notable innovative experience was the Development of Appropriate Meth- ods for Community Forestry in Turkey project, implemented in 1992-95 in the Erzurum/Uzundere, Amasya/Vezirkopru and Sinop/Duragan areas. The project tested and developed methods for participatory community forestry, village development and resource management in 20 of the poorest forest villages, which suffered from infertile soils and harsh conditions for agriculture and silviculture. The objective was to establish resource management to improve the socio- economic conditions of forest villagers and reduce pressure on natural resources. 258 CHAPTER 4 / COMMUNITY FORESTRY: TURKEY Training in better co-management of energy in forests was given through par- ticipatory programmes. Field activities included provision of beehives, establishment of walnut nurs- eries, assistance with food preservation, construction of a fish hatchery, erosion control and introduction of participatory catchment planning and management. Most importantly, ways of reducing fuelwood use were demonstrated, includ- ing use of solar energy for communal laundering. Some of these methods of communal forest energy management have since been widely adopted. At the start of the project, some foresters opposed unfamiliar and uncon- ventional community forestry approaches. Constraints included lack of self- reliance, poor nutritional status and the low status of women. Acceptance of community forestry was fostered, however, through: participatory explorations of village problems and possible solutions; provision of skills in training, feasibility studies, group behaviour, mar- management methods to approve and fund components of household and The project stimulated awareness of community forestry concepts and methods among villagers and foresters. Their involvement in activities led to self-reliance, improved income and a better protected environment, which may help reduce migration from rural to urban centres. Above all, the innovative experience has provided a model for sustainable forestry energy development for replication in Turkey and elsewhere. keting and economic assessment of activities; community activities.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin A deficiency and its consequences - including xerophthalmia   nutritional blindness, poor growth, decreased immunity and increased severity of infections and mortality - is a critical problem of malnutrition and a major public health con- cern in the developing world. Children are particularly vulnerable: the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that severe vitamin A deficiency threatens 13 million children around the world with irreversible eye damage. Yet vitamin A deficiency and its effects - caused principally by insufficient diversity in the diet - is preventable. Positive results have been documented in some developing coun- tries. In Nepal, an estimated 500 000 people out of a population of 20 million are at risk of total or partial blindness due to vitamin A deficiencies, with millions more affected by less severe forms of the disorder. Over the last decade, the gov- ernment has been committed to raising levels of awareness in health and nutri- tional improvement among rural people and has implemented public health-related measures to tackle problems of vitamin A deficiency in the short and the long term. Short-term measures have involved curative activities such as distribution of megadose vitamin A capsules, measles vaccinations and oral rehydration therapy to treat diarrheal episodes in children. Long-term measures have focused on educational and agricultural interventions to enhance production, distribu- tion and consumption of carotene-rich vegetables and fruits. These activities have combined efforts and expertise of relevant government ministries and Tribhuvan University. One of the most notable long-term initiatives has been a joint project of the Government of Nepal and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), supported by the Government of the Netherlands: Multisectoral Training in Nutrition for the Prevention of Vitamin A Deficiency. This initiative successfully integrated nutrition/vitamin A concepts into existing training cur- ricula in the agricultural, educational, health and local development sectors of 49 Inflammation of the conjunctiva of the eye with abnormal dryness and corrugation. 200 CHAPTER 2 I NUTRITION TRAINING TO PREVENT VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY: NEPAL the country. The 199 1-94 training project aimed to achieve the long-term objec- tive of improving nutrition by increasing production and consumption of carotene- rich foods and increasing the overall economic status of the population, ultimately ending distribution of prophylactic vitamin A capsules. Innovative features of the project included: systematic development of needs-based curricula and training materials for nutrition education; participation of four ministries - agriculture, education, health and local development - in using the material and training their field staff at different levels; introduction of practical nutrition concepts into the government’s adult education programme. One of the key features of this innovative experience was an institutional arrangement facilitating coordination between sectors at policy, programme and operational levels. Ministry experts and trainers were involved from policy for- mulation to implementation of project activities. At policy level were the National Nutrition Coordination Committee (NNCC), made up of high-level personnel responsible for policy issues in the implementing ministries, and the university. At programme level was an expert committee, including at least one member from each sector, two nutrition experts and one senior member of the university, which provided expert guidance to project operating committees. Curricula and teaching materials were developed in workshops attended by all members of the expert committee, representatives of different ministries and nutrition experts. During implementation, experts from one ministry or one sector helped other ministries or sectors, and vice versa. As a result, several sets of curricula on nutrition, with emphasis on vitamin A, were designed, developed and field tested for personnel of the four different ministries and two faculties (humanities and education) of Tribhuvan University working at programme and field levels. Prototype teaching materials and audio- visual materials were developed and training of trainers and target groups was carried out. Coverage of training activities was wide: some 2 400 trainers from various sectors were trained and 60 adult literacy centres were supported, includ- ing training for 800 women neo-literates. The training programmes had a positive impact on developing the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the trainees. The courses and materials developed by the project were - and continue to be - a regular feature of training programmes. The project has proved effective in motivating important institutes to inform and mobilize national experts, administrators and other personnel to design and imple- ment nutrition and vitamin A awareness materials at national level, with an SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH 201 emphasis on vulnerable groups, including women and children. This innovative experience in multi-sector nutrition training represents a positive step in creating nutritional awareness among urban and rural commu- nities to improve dietary and health practices for present and future generations. Rather than develop a separate or complementary training programme, the Nepalese project integrated nutritional training into existing sector training pro- grammes. This process was enhanced by an exemplary coordinating mechanism involving all sectors, which could serve as a model for other developing coun- tries tackling nutrition and micronutrient deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Household food insecurity -the lack of access at all times to a sufficient quantity and quality of safe and nutritious food for an active and healthy life - can cause under-nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies, which affect every age group throughout the developing world. Whatever the reasons for food insecurity - agro- ecological, socio-economic or multisectoral- food-based interventions hold the key to addressing and solving the problems in both the short and long term. In Nigeria, a nutrition survey conducted by the Government of Nigeria and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in 1993 revealed that Kano state in the northern savannah zone of the country was facing worsening food insecurity. It had the highest prevalence in the country of stunting or chronic under-nutrition among children under the age of five and alarming statistics for micronutrient defi- ciencies of iron, vitamin A and iodine in adults and children. This had led to a high incidence of malnutrition-related diseases, including marasmus, kwashiorkor and goitre, which were not only undermining health but hindering agricultural pro- duction in a region traditionally considered the bread basket of Nigeria. A project supported by the Technical Cooperation Programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) was launched in Sep- tember 1996 to improve household food security (HFS) and community nutri- tion in Kano state through a comprehensive food-based action and training pro- gramme. By mid- 1998, a four-year food-based action programme and training package for multisectoral extension workers had been developed. It promises to achieve sustained improvement in community nutrition by reducing household food insecurity and increasing per capita calorie intake by 35 percent. A key to the success of the programme was a consultative planning process comprising three tiers of society, community, experts and policymakers, involved in appraisal, development and implementation. This approach strengthened inter- sector cooperation in identifying problems and finding solutions. As an initial step, a community participatory rural appraisal (PRA), was carried out in three agro-ecological zones of Kano state: the dry and wet Sudan savannahs and the Northern Guinea savannah. This exercise improved under- SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH 21 3 standing of the HFS and nutritional situation, identified inadequately exploited potentials and opportunities and recommended food-based interventions for ;mplementation in the three zones and other areas with similar agro-ecological characteristics. A total of 1 71 8 households, averaging ten persons each, were covered, of which approximately 80 percent were found to be food-insecure. Factors leading to or exacerbating the situation included fragmentation of land resulting from population growth, inadequate access to fertilizers, improved seed varieties or pesticides and limited access to labour-saving farm and food pro- cessing implements. The PRA results formed the basis of technical discussions in February 1997 at the National Workshop on the Development of a Food-Based Action Programme for Household Food Security and Nutrition Improvement. Sector-specific plan- ning sessions were subsequently held with each implementing government sec- tor. The draft action programme was discussed by policymakers from line and coordinating ministries at a one-day workshop. Their comments were taken into account in preparation of the final document, which reflected the extent of house- hold food insecurity and malnutrition in Kano state. The government quickly approved the action programme. The action programme addresses four key areas: creating awareness and disseminating information and educational materials on the magnitude and socio-economic consequences of household food insecurity and malnutrition and how these can be minimized using exist- ing food resources; increasing food production through increased productivity and efficient uti- lization of produce; minimizing, if not eliminating, the health factors that undermine food-related nutritional gains; coordinating efforts and monitoring progress towards improvement of food security and nutrition in the state. Parallel to development of the action programme, two training sessions were organized for trainers and extension workers. Participants from all sectors involved in HFS and nutrition improvement were trained in: basic and new concepts in nutrition; crop, livestock and dietary diversification; management of small ruminants; common forms of malnutrition in Kano state; diarrhoea prevention and treatment; participatory planning and implementation of HFS and nutrition interven- tions. 21 4 CHAPTER 2 / HOUSEHOLD FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION: NIGERIA A training manual in English and Hausa was produced through a consulta- tive process to facilitate the training of extension workers and the communities. Implementation of the action programme began in January 1998 with the creation at state level of the Kano State Household Food Security and Nutrition Planning and Coordinating Body. At ward, village and local governmental levels, HFS and nutrition planning and coordination committees will be formed. Exist- ing community associations, self-help groups or village development commit- tees are a suitable entry point for community mobilization. One of the lessons learned through this innovative experience was that devia- tions from planned project activities often have to be made to address community concerns. In the Kano project, it was recognized that lack of drinking water and access to agricultural inputs such as fertilizer and seeds had to be given immediate attention if any progress was to be made in establishing the consultative process. The experience of using such a process to strengthen collaboration in food- based interventions serves as a useful model. Prior to the project, there was no reliable information on the scale of household food insecurity and malnutrition in the area. State activities in HFS and nutrition were limited and uncoordinated. Although identifying problems and finding solutions did take longer through the consultative process, it accelerated approval by policymakers.",

Improving the economic situation of poor women is an important step towards improving their position - but an improved economic situation cannot be viable without improving women’s health conditions and social attitudes towards women in general. The Women, Population and Development (WPD) programme described here comprised several United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) projects imple- mented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Experience of the programme, which was an attempt to empower women, shows how interrelated components affected targeted women in terms of improving their earning capacity, social status and health care conditions, particularly regarding increased information and improved MCH/FP services. Through the programme, a revolving fund mechanism made it possible to extend benefits to a large number of women and a social development fund paid special attention to women’s social needs. The formation of women’s groups played a key role in uniting women in their activities and, as groups gained strength, permitted women to become more independent. At the same time, the establishment of a county governing body in each county secured the commit- ment of local leadership to the programme. This in turn became a channel for the advocacy of women’s empowerment. Towards the end of the programme, which had a comprehensive approach and many goals, the following improvements had been noted: increased decision-making power of women in both the household and the greater economic dynamism; better social skills; improved gender relations within the household; greater community cohesion; improved health care and family planning services. community; 268 CHAPTER 5 /EMPOWERING WOMEN: CHINA INTRODUCTlON The last two decades have witnessed rapid economic development in China through policy reform and opening up to the outside world.

At about the time China began adopting reform and opening up, the government launched a family planning programme to cope with its increasingly serious population situation.

    "abstract": "A two-year pilot project, Improving client-oriented extension training in Ethiopia, was launched in 1996, with the aim of improving the capacity of national and regional Agricultural Extension Department staff to design and implement exten- sion training for farmers, or clients. The focus was on gender issues, using par- ticipatory approaches, and on developing a gender-sensitive analytical frame- work for planning and implementing agricultural programmes to be undertaken by the Ministry of Agriculture at central and regional levels. The pilot project, involving staff from all levels of the Ministry of Agricul- ture, was carried out in one zone in each of three different regions of the coun- try. Activities included a workshop and case studies in each zone to develop appropriate methods. This experience was used as a basis for the regional and zon- al training of trainers in participatory approaches, techniques and tools, gender, gender roles and gender analysis in extension planning. A handbook and video were produced on the basis of this experience. Grassroots staff were trained and the approach was then implemented in a number of villages. The experience was reviewed during a second training-of-trainers phase and the approach subse- quently improved, with training provided on how to incorporate findings into the extension planning process. In addition, three of the trainers who had attended a course abroad on participation and development provided training based on relevant aspects of their experience. A second handbook was produced, outlining the agreed approach. Extension staff in the pilot areas were able to involve female and male vil- lagers in identifying and prioritizing problems and solutions through participa- tory approaches. Having been trained in gender and gender analysis, the gender- aware staff were able to learn about the activities and constraints of both men and women of different social and age strata and carry out gender analysis at field level. Opportunities for development, identified by different clients in the community, were then incorporated into the extension plan for the location. For the first time, farmers in the pilot areas had the opportunity to be involved in and contribute to extension planning. This was particularly innovative for 280 CHAPTER 5 / CLIENT-ORIENTED EXTENSION TRAINING: ETHIOPIA women, many of whom had never been consulted before about their extension needs and constraints. Because the extension staff related to groups of women separately from men and used participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools that over- come the barrier of illiteracy, all of the women - young and old, low and high- income, single, married, divorced and widowed - were able to demonstrate, analyse and explain their situations. The use of participatory approaches and gender analysis was new to Ministry of Agriculture staff. Many important lessons were learned about the client- oriented approach in terms of logistics and methods, networking, links and aware- ness training, capacity building and institutionalization of the process. In par- ticular, it was observed that a cycle of empirical learning and action in the training process was most effective in enabling staff to practise, modify and improve the approach. The project did face some obstacles. The Ministry of Agriculture was in the process of reorganization and there was much staff movement and many demands on them, so the timing of activities had to be flexible. Another problem was that of raised expectations amongst villagers when a team of staff came to work with them. It was essential to explain the position of the team and what the villagers could and could not expect from them. There were positive factors, however, including a favourable policy environment and the use of selected extension staff as project coordinators at regional and zonal levels. The innovative experience in Ethiopia achieved promising results in making agricultural extension training relevant, responsive and sustainable. In particu- lar, a client-oriented approach brings women into the mainstream of develop- ment activities and helps countries realize their full agricultural potential.",

    "abstract": "Women play a central role in the conservation, management and use of bio- diversity, the Earth’s rich animal and plant resources, on which life depends. Their contribution, however, is often overlooked. They are “invisible” partners from grassroots to policy level. If biodiversity is to survive, women and men must play an equal part in its management. There is therefore an urgent need to consider gender - who does or uses what and how and why - in development efforts, to promote true partnership and ensure the sustainable conservation and use of biodiversity now and in the future. In 1997, the Indian non-governmental organization (NGO), the M.S. Swami- nathan Research Foundation (MSSRF), with support from the Food and Agri- culture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), conducted a research project on Gender Dimensions in Biodiversity Management in different locations through- out India, focusing primarily on gender roles in agro-biodiversity. This analysis of the roles played by women and men in managing bioresources is a compar- atively unexplored but crucial subject, which allows us to re-examine current practices and understand their gender implications. Equipped with this gender- sensitive knowledge, it should be easier to avoid past mistakes and meet the needs, opportunities and constraints of women and men in the future. India’s immense bio-geographic, socio-economic and cultural diversity can- not be comprehensively described in a small selection of case studies. Yet, each of the seven case studies covered in this report - Wayanad, Kolli Hills, Jeypore Tract, Bhitarkanika, the Lakshadweep Islands, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram - represents a distinct ecosystem or region of significant biological diversity that is currently under threat. The studies highlight dynamic communities in different stages of transition and development, where livelihood security may conflict with the requirements of biodiversity management. Overall, the MSSRF project found that in the field of biodiversity manage- ment, gender roles are socially constructed rather than biologically determined. Considerable variations were found in the work done by men and women in different locations, with the same tasks, such as seed selection or winnowing, SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT I N  THE SOUTH 295 being done by women in some communities but not in others. In areas of tradi- tional agriculture, among communities and classes that did not practise gender seclusion, women’s participation in biomass-related activities was high and their knowledge and interest in conservation was apparent. Women’s involvement with conservation practices such as preservation of high-quality seed was high in communities where they were the main food producers. Examples are the Apatanis of Arunachal Pradesh and the Garhwalis of the Western Himalayas. The same is true of areas where women shared joint responsibility, such as among the Mizos, Nagas and some hill tribes of the Western Ghats. The project found that this traditional knowledge base was being eroded by changes related to age and gender as, for example, in parts of Orissa. In agriculturally developed areas where market forces had penetrated deeply, such as Tamil Nadu, women were less involved in conservation practices but continued to play a role in seed preser- vation. The research clearly showed that there is a simple division of labour, skills and knowledge along gender lines and that age and education are increasingly important factors in determining gender roles and knowledge of natural and eco- logical resources. While there are encouraging indications, it is too early for precise assessment of the impact of these innovative studies. The exercise represents an initial attempt to understand the links between gender and biodiversity, highlighting a number of gender considerations in conservation and resource use. It has undoubted potential to influence the programming of biodiversity management by local community groups and to motivate national and regional initiatives. India is in danger of losing its rich biodiversity unless immediate and urgent steps are taken in the Western Ghats, the northeast region, the Jeypore tract of Orissa and coastal ecosystems. The voice of nascent women’s groups in these biodiversity-rich areas needs to be recognized and strengthened and their organizational units need to be extended, so that action to manage biodiversity achieves short- and long-term success. The MSSRF findings could offer potential for more flexible approaches in the future. On the basis of a brainstorming workshop held at Chennai on 9-10 June 1997, for example, recommendations were drawn up for an Agenda for Action at national and international level. Action research programmes were recommended to integrate the gender dimension in the following three areas: conservation: in situ, in situ on-farm and ex situ; sustainable utilization; ethics and equity in sharing benefits. The meeting called for national legislation to integrate the gender dimension 296 CHAPTER 5 I GENDER AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT: INDIA and considered the importance of a future National Community Biodiversity Movement, which would pool the capacities of existing networks of groups and associations.

    "abstract": "Rural and farm women are generally among the most disadvantaged groups of a population, yet they play a key role in agriculture and rural development. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been sup- porting countries in formulating national action plans for the integration of rural women in development. Its own FA0 Plan of Action for Women in Develop- ment (1996-2001) is being followed. This plan was a response to the challenges of the 1990s and the recommendations of international fora. As a result, the needs of rural women, who are often “invisible”, are being brought to the forefront of development worldwide. The innovative experience described here concerns the encounters and lessons learned while preparing and implementing the National Action Plan for the Inte- gration of Rural Women in Development in Slovenia, one of the first such plans in Europe. Slovenia, like many Central and Eastern European countries in transition, has undergone social changes which have highlighted issues such as poverty, social security, unemployment, traditional values and social rights. These have important implications for rural and farm women, who have in general been mar- ginalized, with priority given to so-called working women. There has been a lack of support for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working with women. The five objectives of the National Action Plan for the Integration of Rural Women in Development in Slovenia are to: improve farm women’s quality of life and empower them through increased access to information, education, action research and institutional support; provide equal access to employment and natural resources; improve farm women’s access to social and health resources; promote gender equality as a basis for relations in private and public life; promote a holistic concept of gender issues in the political system. The plan can be divided into five parts: 1. a summary of Slovenia’s present socio-economic and political situation; 2. a description of the socio-economic position of farm and rural women, 31 4 CHAPTER 5 / RURAL WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT: SLOVENIA focusing on education and training, the health system, reproductive work, pro- ductive employment and extension services; 3 .  the political arena in a period of transition, emphasizing the social and legal status of farm and rural women, their access to government machinery, their opportunities to participate in politics and the role of NGOs; 4. areas of concern - social, economic and political issues; 5.  recommendations on approaches to problems related to women’s integra- tion into development, complemented by a list of stakeholders and a time schedule for implementation of the plan. Preparation of the National Action Plan took almost two years and involved identifying areas of concern, defining objectives, choosing methods, organizing resources and support for research and identifying stakeholders. This was fol- lowed by the challenge of increasing public and political awareness in order to implement the plan. Negotiations for implementation began in 1996. The formulation process was participatory, involving farm and rural women, government offices and institutions involved in women’s issues and/or devel- opment of rural areas and NGOs in identifying areas of concern and future actions. The process was not without difficulties, notably lack of interest among rural and farm women, little holistic thinking about gender issues, absence of gender- sensitive statistical data and limited access to sources of information. Most prob- lems were overcome and negotiations on implementation of the national plan took place with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food. Negotiations were held on appointing a monitor to oversee implementation of a more gender- sensitive policy at the ministry. The National Office for Statistics was consid- ering inclusion of gender-sensitive data in its reorganization. The unique nature of the experience consisted of detailed analysis of issues affecting integration of rural and farm women in development and involving all segments of the population. Important lessons were learned from the experience. First, it is vital to obtain access to data and knowledgeable informants involved with decision making and policy formulation. Collecting data to formulate the plan was an important step, since it contributed to increasing awareness among all stakeholders, including farm and rural women themselves. Second, imple- mentation of the plan will be a long process. Third, despite positive response to the plan in many quarters, much more remains to be done. Fourth, lobbying will be a powerful tool in raising women’s issues and implementing the plan. Perhaps the most important lesson from the experience in Slovenia was the need to raise self-esteem and assertiveness among farm and rural women.

    "abstract": "The idea behind the People’s Participation Programme (PPP) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) grew in the early 1980s in response to the 1979 World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Devel- opment (WCARRD) in Rome. The programme aims to give the rural poor a more active role in development, enhancing collective self-help capacities through promotion of self-help groups. These groups, assisted by trained promoters, are organized around an income-generating activity common to the members. Since the programme began in 1982,14 pilot projects have been implemented in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The PPP project in Zambia is one of the most successful of the seven in Africa. The innovative experience described here charts the three-phase 14-year rural organization-building project in Western Province, highlighting problems over- come and lessons learned. Funded by the Government of the Netherlands, exe- cuted by FA0 and implemented by the Department of Agriculture of Zambia’s Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, the project initially covered only three districts in the province. By 1996, it was operating in all six. Because of the preva- lence of poor sandy soils, these areas are among the least agriculturally developed. There were few traditional organized groups among the rural population in Western Province, particularly those engaged in income-generating activities. It is a poor province with a land area of 126 386 km2 and a scattered population of only 6 10 000 people and lack of organized groups made it impossible to estab- lish a cost-effective communication and development support network. Attempts to promote a Provincial Cooperative Union had failed, rendering it virtually impossible to support development work. Scarcity of income and employment- generating opportunities for the poor had led to substantial migration, particu- larly men, to urban areas in search of work. Women had consequently assumed responsibility for managing farm households, but were marginalized because they were not involved in development activities or extension services. Eco- nomic decline was aggravated by government handouts that bred dependence on grants and credits. The project covered 32 action areas, in which there were I5 action area com- mittees, or inter-group associations (AACs) and 30 locally recruited group pro- SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES 5 /AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT I N  THE SOUTH 335 moters to facilitate formation and development of self-help groups. In order to maintain relevance to local communities, group promoters living permanently in the action areas were recruited and given in-service training to compensate for low levels of formal education. Five coordinators supervised the work of promoters at district level. The PPP focused on forming self-help groups, which were kept to 8-15 mem- bers to facilitate collective problem solving and group learning. Group mem- bership was as homogeneous as possible in terms of socio-economic status and common interests, to minimize conflict between members. The main target bene- ficiaries were rural poor women with low incomes, limited access to services and poor nutritional status. Group promoters were predominantly female. They provided basic training on such issues as group formation and dynamics, group planning and problem solving. Groups then formed and identified their activi- ties, typically including handicrafts, agricultural production, fishing, sewing or fruit processing. The group promoters then provided additional practical train- ing in basic agriculture, bookkeeping, credit/savings and small business man- agement. Efforts were made to integrate PPP fully into local institutions to ensure sus- tainability and continuity. The PPP credit component, valued initially at US$30 000 was administered by the Western Province Cooperative Union (WPCU) on behalf of the programme. The credit component did not work well, however: few groups gained access to loans and the repayment rate was a mere 50 percent. The PPP changed to a “savings first” strategy and took over management of the credit programme, improving efficiency and stimulating saving among group mem- bers. From zero savings in 1982, groups had an average US$28 in savings in 1997, to be used by groups in times of crisis or lent to members. The economic situa- tion of group members improved markedly as their incomes and assets increased. In spite of droughts, production of major crops rose significantly. An improved standard of living was reflected in increased consumption of fish and meat and the number of daily meals, which went up from two to three. With the collapse of the cooperative movement, there was no local structure to support PPP groups, so the PPP provincial support team was changed into a non-governmental organization (NGO) called the People’s Participation Service (PPS). This ensured that activities initiated under PPP were sustainable and, as long as some donor support was rendered to PPS, more groups were formed. The PPP experience provided a solid base for the further development of self- reliant groups in Western Province. At the time of writing, two years after ter- mination of FA0 assistance, the process continues. In December 1998, the 336 CHAPTER 5 / PEOPLE’S PARTICIPATION: ZAMBIA province had a network of 419 groups, linked in 22 associations in 34 action areas and serving a total membership of 4 263 persons, 75 percent of whom are women. According to the 1998 project report, this membership represents 14 800 household members. The PPP concept has demonstrated that participation is only possible when rural people can pool resources in pursuit of objectives they set for themselves. Groups are voluntary, self-governing and built around income- generating activities. They have increased members’ access to other rural ser- vices such as agricultural extension, literacy and health and created a forum for women in which they can share ideas, empower themselves and increase their confidence in decision-making. One of the most striking outcomes of group for- mation is that PPP members are now called upon to lead community work. The project benefited from a study tour to a PPP project in Sri Lanka orga- nized for three Zambian women, who were able to observe people’s participation activities and inter-group associations in a different setting. The Zambian team took part in discussions and made field visits, during which the women noted that women’s groups in Sri  Lanka were more active than men’s groups and had become self-reliant. PPP field staff from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Zimbabwe visited the project, exchanging ideas with Zambian counterparts, who learned how successful approaches could be adapted to fit Zambian circumstances. The most important lesson is that development depends on the active involve- ment of people working collectively for mutual benefit. No enticements were used to encourage people to form groups. The concepts of group formation, sharing of knowledge and empowerment within groups gave women a voice in devel- opment, enabling them to access services which would otherwise have been beyond their reach. Sustainability is achieved by forming groups around an income-generating activity identified and financed by the members themselves. The project took more than 14 years to develop a sustainable network of self- help groups, however, demonstrating that a long-term perspective is necessary. In Western Province, the process of forming groups involved fundamental changes in rural people’s attitudes and habits, which took time. It must be stressed that success of the PPP project in Zambia was achieved with a comparatively modest outlay of funds. Its cost-effectiveness resulted from reliance on locally recruited and trained staff, a simple implementation framework and, above all, the power of group work. A further lesson is that credit alone is not enough to stimulate sus- tainable development; it must be supplemented by savings. The savings first concept created a sense of responsibility and financial self-reliance. The PPP experience in Western Province had a positive impact on incomes and food security in the area, both critical for long-term development of rural communities in the developing world.

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE India, like several other countries of the South, has a medical setup which is dominated by the Western allopathic system of medicine with its heavy dependence on high-tech equipment and serviced by a drug market controlled largely by multinational drug corporations. This system was imported during colonial rule and initially, its practice was kept aside exclusively for the ruling class. Today, that bias remains, as most allopathic doctors prefer to practise in the urban areas and avoid rural practice, if they can, altogether. Increasingly, the question that is being asked today is whether this allopathic system, with its emphasis on the curative approach and its dependence on capital-intensive technology and invasive techniques, including expensive drugs, can ever hope to meet the basic health needs of the Indian population, particularly those 4 PART I: SOCIAL POLICIES with not much money in their pockets. This is but one aspect. The other is the growing disillusionment with allopathic medicine itself as a theory of health and disease. It is now becom- ing apparent to large classes and masses of people that allopathy is often pow- erless in curing illness or preventing people from dying. Many patients pat- ronise it simply because it is the dominant system, not because they are con- fident of gaining any relief. In fact, allopathic-based treatment often adds to the cost of living and succeeds equally often in turning death into an expen- sive process as well. The result of this realisation has been a fairly large-scale conversion of people from allopathy to other ‘pathies’, aided in no small measure by recent books on ayurveda like those written by the best-selling author, Deepak Chopra. Like other Asian countries with long civilisational histories, India too has had a fairly well-organised system of medicine, known as ayurveda, which is sev- eral centuries old. Other traditional systems which developed a little later (but which are equally ancient) include siddha and unani. The Indian tradition of health care has also promoted several non-drug therapies like yoga (as old as ayurveda) and naturopathy (fairly recent). The system of homeopathy is also quite widespread within the country. With the exception of homeopathy, which originated in Germany, and naturopathy, all these systems of Indian medicine have continued to maintain deep-seated roots in the scientific and cultural traditions of this country and have provided cost-effective and efficacious health care to its populations through the centuries. We can confidently assert that if they have proved use- ful for the survival of these societies for over 5,000 years, they can provide a similar function both today and tomorrow. Because of the impact of colonialism (which looked down on traditional systems of medicine), very little was actually done to either support or pro- mote such medical systems while India was under foreign rule. On the con- trary, efforts were made to deride them and drive them out of existence. This policy changed somewhat after the Indian independence movement gained strength in the thirties. Largely as a result of the Swadeshi agitation, the Na- tional Planning Committee (NPC) set up by the Indian National Congress in 1938 took a decision to absorb practitioners of ayurveda and unani systems into the formal health setup of independent India. In 1946, the Health Ministers’ Conference adopted the NPC proposals and resolved to make appropriate financial allocations for: (a) research, based on the application of scientific methods, in ayurveda (b) the establishment of colleges and schools for training in diploma and and unani; degree courses in indigenous systems; PROMOTION OF INDIGENOUS SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE IN INDIA 5 (c) the establishment of postgraduate courses in Indian medicine for gradu- (d) the absorption of vaids and hakims as doctors, health workers etc, (e) the inclusion of departments and practitioners of Indian medicine on As a result of the Conference resolutions, the government set up the Chopra Committee on the Indigenous Systems of Medicine to work out guidelines for the implementation of the above proposals. The Chopra Committee eventu- ally came out in support of a synthesis of the Indian and Western systems through integrated teaching and research. It recommended that the curricu- lum be designed to strengthen and supplement one system with the other, with each making up for the other’s deficiencies, while research should be concentrated on removing useless accretions to ayurveda and making it intel- ligible to modem minds since a large portion of the texts were in Sanskrit. The ultimate objective of the research ought to be a synthesis of Indian and Western medicine which was suited to Indian conditions. The Chopra Committee was followed by the Dave Committee which went into the issue of establishing standards in respect of education and regulation of practice in ISM. The Committee recommended an integrated course of teaching and some states in the Indian Union in fact started integrated col- leges which taught both modem medicine and ayurveda. In other states, how- ever, pure ayurveda colleges were also established. Eventually, the support for integrated colleges declined while pressure for pure ayurvedic colleges increased. Ayurvedic practitioners and supporters of ayurveda generally pointed to the popularity of indigenous practitioners; the higher cost of integrated colleges due to the expensive equipment required to teach Western medicine; the tendency to spend too much time on allopathy; the availability of indigenous graduates for rural practice and finally, the in- herent incompatibility of the two systems. Eventually, the supporters of a pure system of education and training for ayurveda gained political support in the country’s political circles. This led to the formation of several independent Councils for looking after the research, development, training and regulatory aspects relating to ISM. Today, ISM has expanded considerably and it will not be too long before its practitioners demand equal, if not better, treatment from the government. Thus, the Indian government’s policy of commitment to the development of the Indian systems of medicine is a rather outstanding example of the efforts of one nation in the South not only to reclaim its cultural heritage but also to make available several functional (and cheaper) options of health care to its population in addition to the imported allopathic system. ates in Western medicine; after scientific training where necessary; and official boards and councils. 6 PART I :  SOCIAL POLICIES",

    "abstract": "THE PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE In almost all Third World countries, housing the urban poor in suitable conditions is an uphill battle. The pace of urbanisation, the rate of economic growth, the availability of land for housing, the increase in land prices and inappropriate strategies for urban planning and land appropriation all directly contribute to this problem. Most governments have attempted to implement housing programmes in order to house their urban poor. However, such pro- grammes have usually met with failure or only limited success. Efforts to improve their quality of life are also often negated by the rapidly deteriorating housing conditions in the slum and squatter areas. The lack of appropriate planning and land policies hinders any attempts to effectively shelter the poor. To further compound this problem, city-planning and management policies are often at odds with the policies designed to obtain and maintain adequate shelter for the urban poor. This is the general situation in the majority of Asian countries. However, Singapore has been a notable exception to this rule. Singapore has been able to implement city-planning and urban-management policies that actually ben- efit the poor, and its housing programme has been successful and admired for producing low-cost, affordable housing on a mass scale. Its present-day situ- ation, however, evolved out of the same problems and conditions that still blight other Third World countries today. The rapid growth of Singapore island at the turn of the century produced slums in the central city area. In 19 18, the Colonial Administration set up a Housing Commission to study the housing problem in the central area. The results of the study led to the setting up of the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) in 1927 with the mandate of housing the homeless. It was empowered PROVISION OF PUBLIC HOUSING IN SINGAPORE 13 to plan roads, regulate sanitary conditions of buildings and draw up schemes for land acquisition. The SIT was, however, not given the authority to carry out large-scale housing construction. As a result, during its 32 years in exist- ence, it only completed 23,000 units of flats. In 1947, when the Housing Committee was set up, it produced some shock- ing findings. 72% of the population or 680,000 people lived within the central city area. About a third of the population were living within an area of 4 square kilometres. Urban slums burgeoned, breeding disease, encouraging crime and posing fire hazards. The Land Acquisition Ordinance which was passed in 1920 was amended in 1946 and 1955 to give the government powers to acquire more private land for comprehensive new-town development and to seek price stabilisation. However, the powers granted were limited and the process was cumbersome and slow. The SIT had only been given building authority in 1932 and man- aged to construct 20,907 units between 1947 and its demise in 1959. Its con- struction rate by then was one new flat per year per 150 families. By 1959, the SIT had only managed to house a meager 8.8% of Singapore’s 1.6 million people. The population density within the city centre area was estimated to be 50,200 persons per square kilometre in 1957. Large numbers of people still lived in continually deteriorating overcrowded slums and squatter areas with virtually no service facilities. It was estimated that in 1959, around 250,000 people were living in dilapidated pre-war housing in the central city area and around 300,000 were living in shanty huts in other congested squatter areas. This was the situation that the present Singapore government inherited when it came into power in 1959. The government was faced with a lack of professional manpower, an inadequate building industry and limited financial resources. It had committed to fulfilling its election promise to construct 10,000 units of low-cost housing annually in its first five-year programme. On 1 Feb- ruary 1960, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) was established to carry out this task. Singapore also faces an extreme shortage of land. Its total land area is currently approximately 640 square kilometres. The population of Singapore was 3.02 million in 1990, and has been increasing at an average of 1.7% annually since 1967. Population density is amongst the highest in Asia, sec- ond only to Hong Kong. In 1990, population density was approximately 5,000 people per square kilometre. Nearly half of the available land in Singapore is already built up, while a considerable proportion consists of land designated as water catchment areas, forest reserves and for military establishments, which can never be put to economic use. 14 PART I: SOCIAL POLICIES",

    "abstract": "THE PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Value and exploitation of indigenous knowledge The current value of the world market for medicinal plants, derived from leads given by indigenous and local communities, is estimated to be US$43 billion. Yet only a tiny fraction of the vast assemblage of plants in tropical rainforests has been evaluated for medicinal potential. A larger fraction still remains unexplored. The value of crop varieties improved and developed by traditional farmers to the international seed industry is estimated to be US$15 billion. Other natural products developed from the knowledge of indigenous and local communities (biopesticides, sweeteners, perfumes, fabrics and cos- metics) are expected to be commercially lucrative and worth a world market of several billion dollars. Biodiversity prospecting It is reported that of recent bioprospecting projects documented by a non- governmental organisation (NGO), Rural Advancement Foundation Interna- tional (RAFI), 83% were of the South’s terrestrial biodiversity. At the same time, Northern governments and multinational corporations are vigorously seeking to extend their intellectual property rights regimes to plants, animals and micro-organisms through the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement of the World Trade Organi- sation (WTO). This poses a grave threat to the nurturers of biodiversity - farmers, indig- enous peoples and local communities. Their knowledge systems, and tradi- tional cultural, social and economic lifestyle and practices are being usurped and undermined by these processes, by what amounts to biopiracy, as a result of which they have to pay a market price for their return. UPOV, FA0 and farmers’ rights The emergence of property rights for commercial benefits in genetic re- sources began in the 1960s with the Union for the Protection of New Varieties MODEL LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY KNOWLEDGE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 29 of Plant (UPOV). On the rationale that source material formed the common heritage of mankind, the South, wherein the biodiversity was concentrated, was tapped freely by corporate interests, predominantly from the North. Ig- noring the innovative knowledge and contribution of local communities to the evolution of seeds and genetic resources, these corporate interests modi- fied the plant variety, thereby claiming property rights on the same basis as for a claim for a patent on an invention of an industrial product (i.e., novelty, industrial application and originality). The germplasm, taken for free from developing countries, was now returned as a commodity at a price. This inequitable treatment spawned a debate in the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in the 1970s. This led the FAO, in its 22nd session in 1983, to adopt an undertaking which recognised free access to basic source materials as well as to improved and elite varieties. In the March 1987 meet- ing of the FAO’s Commission on Plant Genetic Resources (CPGR), the South asserted that innovation was an integral part of farmers’ breeding of their seed varieties. These debates finally led to the international recognition of both plant breeders’ and farmers’ rights in 1989 which was unanimously approved by more than 160 countries in the FA0 Conference in 1989 and 1991. The contribution of the traditional farmer in developing the plant was acknowledged. But the right was not vested in the individual farmer. Instead, it accrued to the farmers’ governments, which would receive assistance in the maintenance of genetic resources. It is essentially a general obligation of the North to help the South, tied into the context of aid and dependency. The 1991 revision of UPOV then further restricted farmers’ rights. The protected variety may still be used as an initial source of variation for the creation of new varieties but such new varieties cannot be marketed or sold without the plant breeders’ right (PBR) holder allowing it. As the PBR holder will want to maximise his sales and profit, his authorisation will almost cer- tainly not be given. Breeders’ rights have also been extended to cover not only production for sale, but also reproduction, multiplication, conditioning for the purpose of propagation, and exporting/importing and stocking for these purposes. The Convention on Biological Diversity The Convention was signed by 150 States in 1992 and its obligations came into force in 1993. It aims to bring about a locally-based global system of conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. The Convention recognises that States have sovereign rights over their natural resources. It is subject to their national legislation. Thus, the “com- mon heritage principle” is abandoned in favour of “sovereignty over natural 30 PART I: SOCIAL POLICIES resources.” The State thus regulates access and can deny it if it be inimical to its national interest. The Convention obliges States to endeavour to “create conditions to facilitate access for environmentally sound uses” by other States and not to impose restrictions that run counter to the Convention’s objectives. Its objectives declared in Article 1 are: (a) the conservation of biological diversity; (b) the sustainable use of its components; and (c) the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisa- As authority to determine access rests with the State, it is the State’s leg- islation which will determine what constitutes “environmentally sound uses”. The Convention stipulates conditions (in addition to those set out by na- tional legislation) for the granting of access to genetic resources. Thus, access shall be: tion of genetic resources. (a) on mutually agreed terms (Article 15.4); and (b) subject to prior informed consent of the State of the resource (Article With regard to technologies which make use of genetic resources, the Convention obliges States to take legislative, administrative or policy meas- ures to give access to and transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms to other States, especially the developing countries which provide the genetic resources. The technologies include those that are protected by patents and other intellectual property rights (IPRs) (Article 16.3). The whole of Article 16 on the transfer of technology and IPRs is unclear. It is therefore open to interpretation and definition. The Convention calls upon Contracting Parties to ensure that such IPRs are supportive of and do not run counter to its objectives. The Convention, recognising the role of indigenous and local communities in conserving and sustainably using biological diversity, states that the benefits arising from their knowledge and innovation should be equitably shared and urges States to initiate methods for the development and use of indigenous and traditional technologies in pursuance of conserving and using biological diversity. It fur- ther exhorts Parties to protect and encourage customary use of biological re- sources in accordance with traditional cultural practices that are compatible with conservation or sustainable-use requirements. However, access and benefit sharing (ABS) mechanisms are being nego- tiated with greater frequency, which is then given added value by the North, complete with being accorded IPRs, and then returned to the South at an in- flated price -a repeat, indeed, of the colonial-type pattern of trade in a Third World commodity which has resulted in the present North-South “unbalance” of trade terms, and pauperised large parts of the Third World (Nijar, 1998). 15.5). MODEL LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY KNOWLEDGE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 31 It is often the national governments which enter into these “biotrade” arrangements. Policy-makers, operating within the context of the market economy, often feel that there is little option but to realise the maximum fi- nancial benefits for a country tied up to the paradigm of the marketplace. In short, it is no different from the negotiations that Third World countries enter into with the countries of the North to attract investments - in this case, for the bioresources to be exploited. In a sense, perhaps this approach was a response by the Third World countries to rectify the inequity of past practices where the North accessed their resources for free. The emphasis is then on an equitable sharing of the benefits derived from the commercial exploitation of these re- sources. Although Article 15 recognises that States have sovereign rights over their natural resources and that national legislation will prevail, there is often no single coherent legislation to govern access in most countries (Nijar (Paper l), 1996). Instead, it is spread across a diaspora of legislation over different sectors of the bureaucracy. This often makes regulation and management dif- ficult, uncoordinated and cumbersome. Often, the legislation is sector-based: fisheries, wildlife and forests. As well, sometimes the authority to legislate constitutionally is distrib- uted between the federal (central) authority and the respective states. This creates serious problems, such as the absence of an integrative approach across the sectors due to the limited scope of various enactments in relation to bio- logical-diversity conservation; a lack of comprehensive coverage of biologi- cal-diversity issues; and, finally, the constitutional distribution of the legisla- tive process between the state and the federal governments resulting in areas of overlap and non-implementation between states. Trade-related intellectual property rights The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations finally led to the establishment of the WTO in 1995. Included in the final text are provisions which have serious implications for the preservation of biodiversity, sustainable development and for the cultures and lifestyles of indigenous peo- ples and local communities of the Third World. In particular, Article 27 of the TRIPS Agreement, which came into force on 1 January 1995, obliges Member States to enact IPR legislation with re- gard to biological resources and biotechnology within a prescribed time. Through the binding dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO, any party found in breach would face cross-sectoral retaliations by the rest of the world. Prior to this, most agreements governing IPRs were under the purview of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), a specialised agency of the 32 PART I: SOCIAL POLICIES United Nations. Article 27(3)(b) obliges Members to provide for the protection of plant varieties. This they may do either by patents or by an effective sui generis system or any combination of these. Members must provide for patenting of micro-organisms and “modified” life forms but may exclude from patentability plants and animals which are not considered to be technologically-improved varieties. A distinction is drawn between genetic material developed in the North by technologists and that which has been developed in the South by farmers or indigenous populations. The TRIPS Agreement reversed completely the efforts of the developing countries in the 1960s to revise patent regimes. It is widely known that the framework for the Agreement was formulated by transnational corporations (TNCs), working through the Intellectual Property Committee (IPC) of the US, the Japanese Federation of Economic Organisa- tions-Keidanren, and the Union of Industrial and Employees Confederations (UNICE) of Europe. It is also generally acknowledged that the Uruguay Round negotiation process was asymmetric and non-transparent, reflecting the reality of the coun- tries’ economic and political power. The differences in expertise between the developing and developed countries were often overwhelming, resulting in the developed countries using their political and economic might to impose their patent regimes on the weaker economies of the world. The implications of the TRIPS Agreement (a )  The destruction of community rights, knowledge, innovation and traditional lifestyles and the non-recognition of traditional plural knowl- edge systems, leading ultimately to the destruction of biodiversity and the traditional communities who nurture it. This comes about because of definitional constructs which selectively favour the North and marginalise the South. Article 27( 1) of the TRIPS Agree- ment states that the criteria for a patent claim for an invention are: it must be new, involve an inventive step, and be capable of industrial application. Im- plicit in these requirements is that there must be an identifiable inventor. This definition almost immediately dismisses the knowledge systems and the in- novations of indigenous peoples and farmers because they innovate commu- nally, accretionally over time, sometimes intergenerationally. Their innova- tions are for the common social good and are not intended for individual ap- plication. Indigenous knowledge is an organised, dynamic system of investigation MODEL LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY KNOWLEDGE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 33 and discovery that is of critical value to the sustainable maintenance of the earth’s diversity. The TRIPS definition takes no account of the knowledge systems of the indigenous peoples. (b)  The usurpation in an unfair and inequitable manner of the innova- tion and knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities The TRIPS requirements for patent claims - novelty, utility, and non- obviousness - are a replication of the US patent law. US jurisprudence on when a product or process is a product of nature and therefore not patentable, and when it is an invention, provides no clear guidelines. US court decisions are very fact-specific and general guidelines have been difficult to delineate. This leaves the field wide open to the making of “convenient” decisions. By conveniently describing the tinkering in the laboratories of the North as creating “non-obvious derivatives” and “a more sophisticated process for extracting, isolating or synthesising the active chemical in the plant or animal extracts or compositions”, the knowledge of indigenous peoples on which these products and processes are based is usurped. These deft definitional manoeuvres obscure the fact that traditional uses, although based on natural products, are not “found in nature” as such. They are products of human knowledge. To transform a plant into medicine, for example, one has to know the correct species, its location, the proper time of collection (some plants are poisonous in certain seasons), the part to be used, how to prepare it (fresh, dried, cut in small pieces, smashed), the solvent to be used (cold, warm or boiling water, alcohol, the addition of salt, etc.), the way to prepare it (time and conditions to be left in the solvent), and, finally, the posology (route of administration, dosage). So, by a reductionism which denies recognition to the diverse and varied knowledge systems of indigenous peoples and local communities, the biopiracy of traditional knowledge is justified. Such knowledge and use of biodiversity is then returned to Third World societies for a price they can ill afford to pay. (c)  A new form of technological protectionism The TRIPS Agreement is part of a broader strategy by the industrialised countries, primarily the US, to restrict access to new technology by develop- ing countries. Environmentally-sound technology may be denied to develop- ing countries or be prohibitively costly. The Third World may lag far behind as the TRIPS Agreement prohibits imitation by reverse engineering and the costs for obtaining licences for the technology are likely to be prohibitive. 34 PART I: SOCIAL POLICIES (d)  Denial of access by developing-country societies to their traditional medical systems and knowledge In many developing countries, where health services are limited or out of reach of the indigent, a majority of the population relies on traditional medi- cine which is largely based on medicinal plants. The Chinese Materia Medica and the Indian Ayurveda are undoubtedly outstanding compilations of me- dicinal plants used in traditional medical systems and dating back some 5,000 years. (e)  Undermining the ethos of Third World societies Third World societies freely exchange knowledge, information, materi- als, seeds, etc. Concepts such as ownership of life, etc. are incompatible with, and often antithetical to, their values and worldview. f) The spread of monocultures This happens as the same crop or animal is promoted by the corporation to maximise its return on its investments in the patent product. This results in the displacement of local varieties and consequent loss of diversity. Monocultures are also ecologically unstable and impair sustainable agricul- ture and practices. ( g )  Other undesirable threats to biodiversity IPRs in genetically-engineered plants, animals and soil organisms are posing a serious threat to biodiversity. For example, the creation of herbicide- resistant crops will result in the greater use of herbicides. It could also result in the creation of super weeds. Genetically-engineered soil organisms may threaten plant life and whole agricultural fields if unpredictable undesirable consequences occur. What emerges from a brief review of these international developments and debates is that there is an acknowledgement that farmers’ and indigenous peoples’ rights are essential for the conservation and protection of biological diversity and that this emanates from a recognition of their diverse systems of knowledge and innovation in biological-resource improvement and utilisa- tion; and that equity demands a sharing of benefits. However, what emerges equally clearly is that the existing international mechanisms are not entirely supportive of this understanding. The Convention is, in actual fact, as legally binding and authoritative as MODEL LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIODIVERSITY KNOWLEDGE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 35 the TRIPS Agreement. But there is already enormous pressure to make the Convention supportive of IPR regimes rather than the other way around. Within a country, the sovereignty of that State takes precedence, and the framework of the Convention may prevail. However, between a foreign IPR holder and a sovereign State, the State’s jurisdiction is limited and cannot countervail the IPR holder (Gaia Foundation and GRAIN, 1998). The search for a coherent legal framework as an alternative to TNC patenting of biological materials is therefore of crucial importance.",

    "abstract": "BY THE PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE The transport needs in Singapore have translated into an escalating use of the private motorised vehicle. In 1981, the rate of car ownership was one in every 15 persons. Today, that rate is one in every 10 persons. In 1981, ap- proximately 33% of all motorised trips in Singapore were by private trans- port. This figure increased to 37% in 1991. Private cars are inefficient road users in terms of the road space they occupy and the number of people that can be transported at any one time. With increasing incomes and the benefits that this confers on the comfort of people’s lives, however, the task of per- suading commuters to rely more on public transportation becomes increas- ingly difficult. In Singapore, the effects of all this have serious repercussions. Land is an extremely scarce commodity at approximately 640 square kilometres. In 1990, with a population of 3.02 million people, the population density of this small island was about 5,000 people per square kilometre. The density of vehicles per mile of road is the highest in the world at 300 vehicles per mile of road. Approximately 12% of land in Singapore is already devoted to land transpor- tation use, and there is precious little space left for any expansion in road capacity. The process of decentralising its population concentration and eco- nomic centres has also led to an increased demand for transportation needs. The consequences of excessive usage of private motorised vehicles are many. Incidences of traffic accidents are due mostly to human error. With increased use of private vehicles, the incidences of human error are thus com- pounded. Traffic congestion along main roads also encourages motorists to use alternative routes and short cuts along narrow residential streets. This 50 PART I: SOCIAL POLICIES nuisance also inadvertently affects the relative safety of residential areas. However, it is traffic congestion with its resulting effects that is the chief concern for policy-makers in Singapore. Traffic congestion causes delay. This translates into, among others, a loss in productivity of the labour force, dete- riorating health due to the stress of traffic congestion, and a lower quality of life as a result of the amount of time wasted idling in traffic. Atmospheric pollution is also increased due to traffic congestion as com- pared to regular usage of a vehicle, moving steadily at moderate speeds. Vehi- cles caught in traffic congestion are at their most polluting. Virtually all vehi- cles are run by burning fossil fuels. Vehicles idling in traffic exacerbate the wastage of already scarce fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, car- bon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, lead and particulates are spewed into the atmosphere. They exacerbate health and res- piratory problems. Sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen could be contribu- tory factors to acid rain. Carbon monoxide and lead are toxic compounds. Carbon dioxide is also the main contributor to global warming. In large cities, road traffic is estimated to contribute to about 70% of noise. Excessive noise interferes with the performance of physical and mental tasks. It also contributes to the decline in the quality of our environment.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE In countries like India, the system of medicine based on allopathy serves no more than 15% of the general population, even though it takes up the lion’s share of the health budget. Accessibility to doctors and drugs is still a major problem for most people in the rural areas. It is common knowledge that doc- tors prefer to congregate in urban areas where they have some hope of recov- ering the enormous sums spent for their education. Rural areas even today lack basic amenities, facilities and infrastructure. For this reason, doctors, like other professionals including engineers, are not inclined to look for jobs 64 PART I I: INDIGENOUS AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES in such areas even though they may be seriously wanted there. Available doc- tors are also expensive and the pharmaceutical drugs they are habituated to prescribe even more so. Thus, even physical accessibility to a modern doctor may not necessarily be a solution since one may not be able to afford his services. Also, allopathic medicine is increasingly being seen as ineffective in a large number of chronic illnesses. Intensive investigations using hi-tech equipment and instrumentation are conducted, costly medicines prescribed and consumed, but the patient complains he is yet to get any relief from his pains or disease. The situation, in fact, has been aggravated due to present liberalisation trends which require the production of drugs in the country to be submitted to new kinds of patent regimes. Naturally, this development is bound to push the prices of pharmaceutical drugs even further skywards - many of them are already too expensive - and consequently further out of the reach of common people. Thus, it is a foregone conclusion that a system of primary health care based on allopathic doctors and pharmaceutical drugs will not be able to live up to its promise of providing even basic health care to people in the rural areas or to the economically deprived in the urban areas. This has been recog- nised at the international World Health Organisation (WHO) level and at the national level. In many primary health care centres in the country, the availability of even basic pharmaceuticals has indeed become a major problem. Such cen- tres are invariably frequented by the poorer sections of the population, par- ticularly women and children. Even basic drugs like aspirin or paracetamol may not be available in the centres’ stock. It is important to remember that such primary health centres are also used as a base by authorities for adminis- tering the series of immunisations that children are given when very young. How, then, does one improve this miserable situation? One solution has come from groups like the Foundation for Revitalisation of Local Health Tra- ditions (FRLHT). The Foundation has, together with other public interest NGOs working on traditional medical systems, argued forcefully for re-orienting public health care policies, at least in India, in the direction of tapping the enormous skills and expertise available with practitioners involved in local or folk health traditions. The same groups have also insisted that more attention be paid to the Indian Systems of Medicine (ISM), notably Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Tibetan Medicine. They point to the example of China, which has continued to treat its indigenous system of medicine on par with the imported Western system. The common point in most of the Asian systems is that they are largely based on plant medicines. The cultures which have given rise to these systems of medicine are also fairly expert in their knowledge of medicinal plants and GROWING HERBAL PLANTS IN HOME GARDENS FOR HEALTH CARE 65 their collection from the wild or their cultivation in specialised gardens. India is a country with major expertise in plant-related medicine. This is a living tradition in the country. Over 7,500 species of plants are estimated to be used by over 4,500 ethnic communities for both human and veterinary health care purposes from the Himalayas to the south of India. In the older medical literature, several plant drugs are recommended for specific problems relating to human, veterinary and plant health which, in Ayurveda, comprise three different, distinct bodies of systematised scientific knowledge. Over 1,700 plants are fully described in terms of their biological properties and actions in the codified medical texts under the Ayurvedic system. The point has also been made that knowledge of the properties of these plants is not based on chemistry or pharmacology but on wholly indigenous category of knowledge called “dravya guna shastra” which cannot be con- verted into modern-day chemistry or pharmacology. Even today, there are over a million traditional, village-resident experts in herbal medicine and they include traditional birth attendants, bone setters, herbal healers and even monks who are well versed in dravya guna shastra. There is also a vast tradition that is very well informed in various home remedies and their preparation, and in important aspects of food and nutrition in so far as they are related to health. Building on this tradition, the FRLHT has been working for several years on a creative scheme for addressing the problems of availability of drugs in the primary health care (PHC) centres and also for individual families through this alternative route. It has researched and honed in on a set of plants, largely from indigenous sources of medical knowledge like Ayurveda, that can be used to treat quite effectively a range of common ailments for which people visit PHC centres or family doctors. The FRLHT has also worked out schemes for production of these plants in different nurseries and herbariums, so that they are easily accessible to such centres. Such herbal gardens are to be man- aged by village communities and can even serve as an important employ- ment-generating system, considering the attention plant drugs are now get- ting all over the globe. The FRLHT’s schemes of domestic herbal gardens and primary health care based on indigenous herbal plants are some of the most interesting social innovations of our time. Since herbs can be easily grown and are cheap, the costs of providing good medicare to people can be considerably reduced and good health care made available and within the reach of all. Medical experts argue that most diseases (almost 75%) are, in any case, self-limiting, that is, the patient will get well after the disease has run its course. A large number of illnesses are of the category of common illnesses, which are not only self-limiting in nature, but whose symptoms can be easily recog- nised and treated with the use of several kinds of fairly effective remedies, 66 PART II: INDIGENOUS AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES including those in the category of “grandma’s medicines” and folk remedies which include plants and herbs. The use of plants in human health care is also not peculiar to India. More than 80% of the population of this planet, according to WHO estimates, con- tinue to rely chiefly on traditional medicine for primary health needs and most of these are based on drugs derived from plants or herbs. The achievement of the FRLHT is of such a nature that it recognises this empirical reality and then works with it to generate practical solutions to make it more effective, using, of course, local expertise and local resources. Needless to say, the herbal- garden concept can be usefully replicated in other communities of the world which also have equally strong traditions of plant medicine.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Agroforestry has been defined as “a collective name of land-use systems and technologies where woody perennials (trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos, etc.) are deliberately used in the same land management unit as agricultural crops and/or animals either in some form of spatial arrangement or temporal sequence.” (Lasco, 1986) There is no word for “agroforestry” in the Cordillera region of the Philip- pine archipelago. But the land and forest are part of the life of the indigenous peoples of the region. And they have practiced systems that nurture the land and forest for centuries. For the Igorots of the Cordillera, the forests are more than just sources of wood, lumber, and exotic plant and animal species; the land is life itself. It is the source of their food, it is their wealth, it is the playground and training ground of their children, it is their home. They must nurture the land and the forests so it shall remain capable of nurturing them. Religious and traditional beliefs, practices and rituals have evolved out of the people’s relationship with the land and the forest. Socio-political institu- tions also play a significant role in the control, use and management of lands, 100 PART 11: INDIGENOUS AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES in addition to determining a tribe or clan’s territorial boundaries. The land and the forest play an important role not only in the economic aspect of their life, but also in the development of their culture and religion, their socio-political systems and their community in general. “Igorot” is the collective term used to refer to the indigenous peoples in the Cordillera region of the northern Philippines. These include the Bontocs, Kalingas and Apayaos; the Ibalois, Kankanais, Isnegs and the Ifugaos (though the Ifugaos simply prefer to be called Ifugaos). The region is presently divided into five provinces, namely, Kalinga Apayao, Mountain Province, Abra, Ifugao and Benguet. The region is so named because it is a cord of mountains that form the backbone of the northern part of Luzon, the Gran Cordillera, the highest and largest mountain range in the Philippines. It is characterized by steep terrain and some of the high peaks in the Philippines. There are three main types of forests found in the Cordillera. These are the dipterocarp, the Benguet pine and mossy forests. These forests make the Cordillera a rich source of hardwood, pine products, pulp, and a wide variety of plant and animal species. The dipterocarp forest of Apayao (an area covered by the province of Kalinga Apayao in the Cordillera region) is thickly vegetated with natural timber forest species like the apitong (Dipterocarpus grandiflorus), white lauan (Shorea contorta), red lauan (Shorea negrosensis), yakal (Shorea astylosa), tangile (Shorea polysperma), mayapis (Shorea palosapis) and guijo (Shorea guiso) (Viray, 1992). The people use this for building houses and for furnish- ings inside their homes. The soil in the Apayao area of the Cordillera region is generally fertile. The abundance of vegetation in the area proves this. Various moss species are also found in some areas and the proliferation of ferns indicates a high content of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium compounds. Other minor forest prod- ucts, non-timber forest products and medicinal plants are also abundant in the area. In addition, there are scattered species of orchids and ornamental plants. Rattan, pandan, palms like ubod, anahaw and taraw, as well as different bam- boo species are also abundant. The indigenous people utilize these for weav- ing baskets and other native handicrafts which they use in their homes and as containers for the seeds and other crops (usually tubers) which they gather from their farms. The mossy forests of the Cordillera are characterized by stunted tree veg- etation usually covered with mosses, lichens, liverworts, epiphytic herbs and ferns, rattans, pandanus, strange bottle-shaped myrmecodias as well as shrubs and climbers of many different families (Viray, 1992). Though oak species and mosses are the dominant vegetation in this type of forest, rare orchids, INDIGENOUS AGROFORESTRY PRACTICES IN THE CORDILLERA 101 wild food and medicinal plants also abound. The faunal composition in mossy forests includes the Philippine deer (Cervus sp.), the wild pig (Sus celebensis), tree shrews (Tupaia sp. and Urogale sp.) and ground shrews (Suncus sp. and Crocidura sp.). It has been reported that in Mt. Polis (also called Mt. Amuyao), a mossy forest located at the pro- vincial boundary of the Mountain Province and Ifugao, both within the Cordillera region, wild deer, monkeys and wild pigs can still be sighted in certain areas. Some people also believe that this particular forest serves as a transit area for migratory birds (Estigoy, 1995). Meanwhile, pine trees grow well in the high plateaus of the Cordillera mountains. The Benguet pine (Pinus insularis) is the only pine species in the region (Viray, 1992). The natural pine stands, which are valuable sources of fuel called saling because of their resin content, are generally quite open and subject to frequent fires. The wildlife present in Cordillera’s pine forests in- cludes rats of the genera Crateromys and Phloemys. Avian species like Zosterops, Dicaeum, Neotarinia, Pyrrhula, Loxia and Erythrura can also be found here. The geophysical feature of the region gives it a climate that is the coldest in the country, especially from November to February. There are two marked seasons - dry and wet. The dry and wet seasons vary by province, but gener- ally, the dry season starts in about November and lasts up to April. After- wards, summer rains come to start the wet season. From July to October, typhoons occur. Observations in recent years have shown some shifting in the arrival and occurrence of typhoons and even of the wet and dry seasons. Lo- cal sources claim that these changes could be effects of the region’s slowly disappearing forests. In the past, some government agencies have blamed the people’s slash- and-burn (kaingin) farming for the destruction of the forests. But the people claim otherwise. They say they have been practicing their indigenous systems of farming for centuries and have maintained the richness of the forest. Mean- while, local sources said, the government has been granting not only logging concessions to foreigners and the rich Filipino elite but also mining privileges to different foreign corporations. These, they say, along with other so-called development projects imposed upon the people in the region, are the reasons behind the loss of the Cordillera’s rich forests.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE More than 25 million families (200 million or 20% of the population) in India are still without a roof over their heads. This is not an unusual scenario in most, if not all, countries of the South. The problem of providing mass housing would be insurmountable if one imagines this vast unsheltered popu- lation can only be housed once adequate quantities of cement and steel (and the funds or loans for these) are available. The fact of the matter is that such quantities will never be available. Even if they were, it does not mean they would be affordable since their manufacture requires expensive imported fu- els. Since the homeless are generally also the economically deprived, it is doubtful if such materials will ever be destined for their use. Modern materi- als and architecture colleges have effectively mired most modern minds, par- ticularly the architects and government bureaucrats, in one-dimensional think- ing. For 5,000 years, people have constructed houses without either cement or steel and provided durable solutions. Several million houses of mud have remained standing for centuries. In India even today, the largest number of houses constructed are out of mud. In contrast, the country’s experience with modern materials is fairly recent. Not enough time has elapsed to enable a proper evaluation and assess- ment of their ability to withstand the forces of nature. There are indications already that they may not pass the long-term test. For example, in most coastal areas, where large numbers of people live, metal rods used in reinforced con- crete construction (RCC) of houses and bridges have been unable to with- stand the forces of corrosion and are giving way. RCC slabs have been unable to protect residents from heavy downpours and these leak profusely. Indigenous building solutions face neither of these problems. The ques- tions to ask of the older architecture are: How did they do it? Are there really REHABILITATING INDIGENOUS TECHNOLOGIES FOR MUD CONSTRUCTION 125 no other construction materials available besides cement and steel? What solu- tions used earlier are still valid today? Is it true that mud is not as strong as cement and steel? Are concrete and steel perceived to be better simply be- cause they are seen to be the result of modern scientific and technological processes; or is this merely one more uncritical assumption we have inherited about the inherent goodness of all modern inventions? Why isn’t mud consid- ered modern? Is this a problem of mud itself or is this merely a problem of the modern mind? Laurie Baker, though trained in formal Western architectural science, was one of the fortunate few who escaped the mental straitjacket imposed on ar- chitects today by modern materials like steel and cement. He spent many years observing how people in the rural areas of India constructed houses and also thoroughly studied the materials they used for construction. He experimented with several materials, improved the scientific basis of several traditional house- building techniques and designed elaborate new homes based on the primary use of mud as construction material. His own house located in Thiruvananthapuram (capital city of Kerala state) is completely constructed out of mud. Inspired by Gandhi, Baker set out to prove to the world, and particularly to India’s architects and housing experts, that mud is as good a material for building houses as cement and steel. In fact, Baker argues that mud construc- tion in environments like those of Kerala is decidedly superior to reinforced cement, for various reasons. Mud houses need never be seen as an inferior product. Houses constructed from mud can also be of five-star quality, if the owner so desires and can afford it, and if the engineer concerned properly understands mud construction techniques. As for housing planners, Baker has continued to insist that mud can also be considered primary construction material for large-scale mass housing schemes since it is ubiquitous and almost free. It is here that he has faced the greatest difficulties since planners see themselves as great modernisers and a priori refuse to entertain the idea that citizens should continue to live in mud houses in the 20th century. They feel this would be morally wrong or civilisationally improper. This is the reason why housing has become a prob- lem for governments since they feel it can only be solved with large quantities of cement and steel. Laurie Baker has proved that this is a fallacy since mud houses are sometimes better than houses made of cement and steel and more comfortable as well. From the economic point of view, they are also still the best solution. From the technical point of view, all problems faced with re- gard to mud housing have been effectively solved: the techniques are well known in the tradition. Where necessary, these techniques have also been modified and improved by architects like Baker so that it is possible to argue 126 PART I I: INDIGENOUS AND TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICES that mud building technology has come of age. Through his advocacy and work, Baker has been able to finally convince bureaucrats and those in charge of planning for housing - at both the national and international levels - that mud should be taken into account as an impor- tant and dignified solution to the problems of mass housing of our times.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Various living organisms lived in perfect harmony and balance with each other in different ecosystems before chemical agriculture and chemical pest control came into the picture. Today, we see a kind of agricultural develop- ment which is based on monoculture and extensive use of chemicals. This has led to the emergence of several pests which has in turn led to the failure of crops. The number of pests developing resistance to pesticides over the years has been increasing at a very alarming rate. The pesticides have proven to be extremely toxic and have led to a number of side effects: impact on public health, toxic residues in food and disturbance of local ecosystems. Use of such chemicals has also led to the eradication of natural predators such as spiders which normally keep pest populations in balance. Use of chemical pesticides has killed off natural predators not only in the agroecosystems but also in households. Several toxic chemicals are often rec- ommended to control pests in households. Often, these chemicals are mistak- enly ingested by children, domestic pets or even birds. The work with spiders detailed in this report was designed to address the problems faced by farmers and homemakers. Mass rearing technologies have been worked out for certain species which can be extended to other groups. 142 PART Ill: APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY This can form a basis for biological control. One of the main reasons many people kill spiders on sight is the ugly- looking web, which they construct for many purposes like catching prey, at- tracting the opposite sex, etc. But the fact is that not all spiders construct webs. There are certain spiders called “Wanderers” which do not construct webs to catch their prey but actively chase them instead. Spiders are benefi- cial to human beings in the sense that they feed on the pests of man such as cockroaches, flies, etc. Predatory arachnids such as spiders are an important group of biological control agents. They are able to survive periods of starva- tion when prey i s  difficult to find. As the use of chemical insecticides gained currency, however, the role of spiders as natural pest controllers was greatly neglected and even forgotten. Today, however, people are becoming increas- ingly aware that in the long run, the harmful effects of the insecticides far outweigh the advantage of temporary pest control. What people are not so aware of is that even creatures commonly found in their own homes can play an important role in controlling domestic pests. The giant crab spider is one such example of a beneficial “house guest”.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE In contrast to temperate soils, tropical soils are known to routinely lose their organic-matter constituents when exposed to either extreme sun, wind or rain. The problem of erosion is exacerbated when tree cover has been re- moved and the soil no longer has the protection of any vegetative cover. It is generally acknowledged that thousands of tonnes of precious topsoil (which contains soil humus) are lost every year due to erosion caused by different agents. As the organic content of the soil thus declines, the soil be- comes inhospitable to the soil fauna, especially earthworms, and, in many cases, turns dead, unable to produce even shrubs or grass. Such losses of soil organic constituents, if they occur in farmers’ fields, will lead to gradual but 152 PART II I: APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY inevitable losses in agricultural productivity, compelling the farmer to depend more and more on expensive synthetic fertilisers and other nutrients even if he recognises that such inputs further damage the soil. The deficiency in the organic component of the soil (or soil humus) can be rapidly made up through the addition of artificial organic manure (like castor seed cake or neem cake) or compost. The former is expensive and must be purchased from the market for a price. Compost, on the other hand, can be made in one’s own backyard. The problem that has been routinely posed with regard to compost, how- ever, is whether it can be made on the scale required. Agricultural scientists have claimed that there is not enough compostible or biodegradable material available within the country for producing the massive quantities of organic compost the country’s tired soils need. They have often used this as an argu- ment to continue supporting the use of synthetic fertilisers even though they concede that the use of such chemicals in the absence of organic matter has led to the creation of more and more infertile and sick soils. The argument has also proven to be a major damper to efforts, both public and private, to stimu- late and train farmers to manufacture compost for their fields. Pandharipande invented his Nadep method of composting precisely to counter the argument that farmers can never produce the quantities of organic compost the soil actually requires. His method can not only be used by farm- ers to fertilise and improve their own fields dramatically, it can be operated as an independent production unit which unemployed village youth can adopt as a sound business proposition. This is because there is perennial demand for large quantities of compost in tropical countries and the traditional methods for producing it have proved singularly inappropriate and inadequate for the requirements at hand.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Dr R.T. Doshi was an economist before he commenced farming. Prior to this, he was associated with the marketing of NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) fertilisers, micronutrients, organic manure, etc. After retirement, he worked on his farm at Kamshet near Pune and discovered the immeasur- able problems farmers face. He discovered that if farmers include the costs of their labour in the calculation of farm profit and loss, all farms would be uneconomical. This led him to think very seriously about reducing the costs of farming, including labour. There were also other problems associated with food production for per- sons living in urban areas. One is the cost of food, which continues to spiral because it is subject to inflation. The other is the quality. The production of food, particularly vegetables and fruits, in many coun- tries of the South is carried out in rural areas and often involves transport over long distances. The lack of an active linkage between such producers and consumers has led to several undesirable practices that place urban populations at risk. 160 PART I l l :  APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY One of the most important of these issues is the present farming practice of dousing most agricultural produce, from grapes to cabbages, with toxic chemical pesticides to enable them to maintain their outward appearance for fetching better prices. Institutional facilities like laboratories which can in- vestigate toxic pesticide residues in market produce are almost non-existent in many countries of the South. Even in countries like India where such facili- ties do exist, actual investigations and sampling can be frightfully expensive and no institution, not even the government, is really willing to pay such costs. One of the alternatives to this unhealthy scenario is to stimulate urban dwellers to grow their own food, particularly vegetables and fruits, in their own backgardens. However, agricultural production of any kind is seen as impossible in urban areas simply because most land is covered up in bitumen and available space is seen to be more profitable if diverted for real estate development instead of being utilised for the growing of vegetables. Cities swallow up agricultural fields with impunity, especially in countries of the South. In these circumstances, Dr. Doshi’s city-garden methods are a major in- novation and qualify easily for good-practice status. Dr. Doshi has perfected a method of growing vegetables and fruits for domestic consumption in avail- able covered urban spaces, including terraces and balconies, and utilising even the walls of civil constructions. He has shown how it is not at all necessary to think that food should only be grown in fields, with expensive irrigation fa- cilities and mechanical equipment like ploughs, harrows and tractors. This has opened up possibilities in the imaginations of urban dwellers of raising nutritionally acceptable food close at hand, within their own premises. In ad- dition, since Dr. Doshi recommends only organic methods of farming, food grown in such city gardens is safe from toxic residues and can be consumed without any anxiety. Dr. Doshi’s methods involve neither extra time nor money, but produce net gains. His gardening materials include sugarcane waste from nearby sugarcane juice vendors and spent polyethylene bags which are nor- mally used to pack cement or fertiliser and are useless thereafter. These cost next to nothing. The only item for which some payment may be necessary is soil, if this is not available in the close neighbourhood. Nothing more is re- quired for the urban gardener to begin a thriving garden producing whole- some vegetables for his family “the Doshi way”. Dr. Doshi today grows vegetables, pulses, fruits and cereals on the terrace of his bungalow in Mumbai located in one of the crowded areas of the city. He has raised mango, fig and guava plants and also harvested bananas and sugarcane stalks. All these crops Dr. Doshi raises only for self-consump- tion and not for sale in any market. He enjoys the exercise tending to the city farm entails and also, of course, the ample fruits of his labours. CITY FARMING INNOVATIONS 161 Dr. Doshi’s innovative practices have now been adopted by several fami- lies in not just Mumbai but adjoining cities like Pune as well, leading to a profusion of city vegetable gardens, and improving local environments, fam- ily nutrition and public health overall.",

Its scientific name, Azadiracta indica, is in fact derived from Azad- Darakth. The Indian people have for millennia used this tree in agriculture, public health, medicine, toiletries, cosmetics and livestock protection. How- ever, there is a threat that the “free tree” will no longer be free. The Azad- Darakth is now the intellectual property of Western scientists and corpora- tions. Patents have been granted for products and processes based on the vari- ous properties of neem. These properties of the neem have been known and have been in use for centuries in India.

Defending people’s rights in an age of biopiracy needs a two-pronged strategy - a strategy of resistance to global monopolies and a strategy of rejuvenation of local traditions. The technology and practices that are being promoted are aimed at reju- venating local low-cost use of neem as a biocontrol agent. It is meant to serve as a sustainable-agriculture initiative. The Centre for Indian Knowledge Sys- tems has been involved in various efforts relating to the use of natural prod- ucts for pest control and crop protection. Over the last several years, the cen- tre has conducted a series of seminars and workshops for farmers, voluntary organisations and academics to propagate the use of neem. CIKS has been involved in an effort to test the efficacy of different plant extracts, such as those of neem, in farmers’ fields. Currently, a number of neem products are commercially available in the market. CIKS’ work has been to see that the extracts developed by farmers in their own backyards are as efficient as or more efficient than what is available in the market. Its mo- tive has been one of self-reliance. This is also an innovation which is eco- nomically viable for small farmers.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Irrigation is commonly considered to be one of the most important factors governing crop and farm yields anywhere in the world. Most governments in the South believe fervently in the irrigation mantra and hence are ever ready to allocate large amounts of public resources to providing irrigation facilities for the production of food and other crops, including fruits. International financial institutions are equally willing to provide loans on easy terms to governments for large irrigation projects, since dams are con- sidered an indispensable modern instrument for supplying regular water for agricultural development. Unfortunately, the experience with many such projects is that it has led to the practice of excessive irrigation, which dimin- ishes productivity, and sets in chain a whole series of problems. Explaining the reasons for this, Bhaskar Save says: “Just as human be- ings need to breathe continuously, so also the roots of plants (excluding aquatic/ semi-aquatic species like mangroves and rice) require non-stop aeration. Ex- cess water drives out the air contained between soil particles, depriving the roots of their most vital need, and thereby disrupting photosynthesis. But soil that is just damp enables non-stop aeration near the roots, resulting in greater efficiency of photosynthesis.” Such continuous soil aeration, emphasises Bhaskar Save, is of fundamental importance for productive, sustainable agri- culture. Bhaskar Save’s understanding of the critical importance of soil aeration was obtained through his observation of the processes at work in natural for- ests, which often grow thickly on well-drained mountain slopes, e.g. the Hima- layas or the Western Ghats. The rain that falls on such steep terrain is drained away rapidly. In many parts, the mountain slopes are 95% rocks and stones and barely 5% soil, yet trees thrive on such land. The main reason for this is the excellent, continuous aeration in the soil that enables efficient photosyn- thesis. In contrast, tree growth is seen to be much more inferior in low-lying terrains, where water accumulates, driving out the air from the soil. Moreover, according to Bhaskar Save, “Prolonged flooding at the roots causes them to rot, resulting in various plant diseases and pest attacks. Even after the excess water in the soil has dried or drained away, much time is lost in regenerating the roots and root fibres, before the photosynthesis of new leaves, flowers, fruits etc. can resume. Thus, any water accumulation around 182 PART I II: APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY the trees/plants, even for a few hours, can cause considerable damage, drasti- cally reducing their yield for the year. “Excess water in the soil also harms the earthworms and aerobic micro- organisms such as various decomposer bacteria, that vitally need oxygen to survive and function. The formation of humus from organic matter by these soil creatures is thus obstructed. The natural tillage function of the soil crea- tures is similarly affected. With the passage of time, the porosity of the soil is reduced, and its capacity to absorb both air and moisture declines. Conse- quently, evaporation losses from the surface increase, and insidious salinisation sets in. “Salinisation of the soil is an extremely serious problem caused by excess irrigation. It is only rainwater that is pure distilled water. The irrigation water drawn from canals (or wells, tubewells etc.) contains salts that have dissolved in it through contact with the earth. When such water is used on the farm, some of it evaporates, leaving the salts behind on the surface of the soil. For example, with 60% evaporation, 60% of the dissolved salts are left behind. This process continues, and a progressively thicker crust of salts is formed on the land. Hot, dry climates with a high rate of evaporation are particularly susceptible to this scourge. “Salinisation greatly reduces the soil’s capacity to absorb air and mois- ture, since these cannot penetrate the hard, sealed surface of the earth. The plants suffer as a result of this. Similarly, the earthworms, micro-organisms, etc. also die of suffocation, speeding up the ruination of the soil. In a vicious cycle, the traditional plough drawn by bullocks can no longer break the hard- ened earth, and the farmer is forced to resort to tractor-ploughing, which only worsens the damage each year. The most serious problems, however, are caused where water-guzzling monoculture cash crops like sugarcane and basmati rice are grown year round, abandoning the traditional mixed-cropping and rota- tion systems of the past. “The problems are compounded by toxic chemicals which increase the irrigation requirement of crops, and poison the food-cycle of nature, killing many helpful friends of the farmer like the earthworms, bees, frogs, spiders and birds. The living soil collapses into dead dust.” Conventional irrigated agriculture is based on several methods. These include channel irrigation, use of sprinklers, drip irrigation, etc. The Israelis have, for example, perfected the art of drip irrigation and are now teaching the technique to the rest of the world. This, however, is not free from problems. Though excessive watering and the consequent salinisation may be largely checked by drip irrigation, the chemicals that are used continue to cause dam- age to the soil. Moreover, both drip and sprinkler irrigation systems are extremely ex- WATER-EFFICIENT TRENCH IRRIGATION FOR HORTICULTURE 183 pensive and require enormous amounts of capital to install. Such capital is unavailable to most farmers in the South and hence, these technologies have remained permanently out of the reach of the large masses of farmers and peasants. In addition to the heavy initial expense, these technologies also manifest other problems: for instance, the drip points in the drip irrigation system can become clogged not only by the salts (as evaporation takes place) but also by dirt, since the discharge points are usually exposed. This reduces the effi- ciency of the irrigation network and increases the costs of maintenance. In addition, chemicals often have to be used to dissolve the salts clogging the dripper points. Of all the various irrigation methods available, channel irrigation is still the cheapest of the systems in vogue and is traditionally the most extensively used irrigation practice in countries of the South. It does not demand any expensive equipment and invariably relies on the use of marginal or farm labour, of which there is a surplus in all countries. The technique basically involves lifting water to a high point in the farm and then letting it flow down channels cut in the earth. These channels lead to either flat enclosed fields (for crops) or to the root zones of plantation trees. These traditional irrigation methods, however, tend to use considerable amounts of water. This is partly because the channels carrying the water are generally unlined, and a fair amount of water may seep into the ground before it reaches the area it is meant to irrigate. However, if such seepage is retained in the earth as soil moisture, or percolated down to recharge underlying aqui- fers, the water would not be totally ‘wasted’. The problem arises mainly be- cause there are considerable evaporation losses from bare, exposed soil. One modern-day method of ‘improving’ the channel system is to line the channels with either cement or plastic. Both these options are expensive. In addition, plastic is a known non-biodegradable material and causes major environmental problems. When used in such open channels, its life-span can also be very short as it can be damaged through exposure to the elements, sharp objects and biotic impacts. More significantly, such ‘solutions’ fail to see where the real problem lies.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE In many of the rice fields of Asia, from the Philippines to India, farmers are expressing a desire to replace the modern varieties of rice with the varie- ties they were planting a few decades ago. This conversion has not come about overnight: farmers have gradually (and sometimes even grudgingly) 208 PART 111: APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY discovered that the so-called “high-yielding” varieties (HYVs) introduced by IRRI and a few national institutes of research as well are seriously plagued with chronic genetic and environmental problems for which no long-term rem- edy exists. These chronic problems include the susceptibility of these modern varie- ties to an entire range of unexpected pests and viruses which often devastate entire areas, leaving the farmer with neither food nor income and sometimes in debt. No sustainable, long-term measure for dealing with these problems of plant disease and insect attack is available except routine advice from scien- tists and companies to farmers to continue spraying ever more toxic mixtures on paddies. The general confidence that rice scientists may be able to solve these problems seems to have been drastically eroded over the past decade. Many of the modern varieties have also reached a productivity plateau: they require more and more fertiliser merely to maintain their present output levels. Productivity is also going down simply because the soil has been mined of all its trace elements and has little left over to feed new plants. The “high- yielding” dwarf varieties are also known sometimes as “high-response’’ vari- eties in view of their enormous appetite for chemical fertilisers. And fertiliser prices are going up everywhere in the South, as they are based on imported feed stock in most cases. The scenario is hardly a desirable one. There is an additional aspect: it is now acknowledged that the modern varieties cannot survive any longer without the infusion of genes from the older varieties and from wild relatives. Most of the modern varieties have, in fact, survived on the genetic crutches provided by the traditional varieties and their more resistant genes. However, as more and more “successful” modern varieties are propa- gated, more of the traditional varieties go out of use and become extinct. If this continues to happen, the future of the modern varieties themselves, on which millions of farmers have been made dependent, would be profoundly at stake. One of the solutions for the conservation of rice germplasm has been the setting up of centralised gene banks in which indigenous or traditional rice varieties and cultivars are maintained under special conditions. However, the reported survival rate of seed maintained in such refriger- ated gene banks is hardly impressive. For this reason, concerned scientists have proposed that rice germplasm should also be maintained in situ, in the fields of farmers. As farmers seek more and more traditional varieties, however, they are bound to encounter problems of seed scarcity. This is because the established PROTECTING DIVERSITY IN RICE: RAPID CLONAL MULTIPLICATION OF RICE SEED 209 rice research institutes are not geared towards addressing this aspect of the problem, that is, towards the multiplication of traditional seed or even to- wards supplying farmers with the seed from their gene banks. In some areas, only a few seeds of a particular variety may be available. The variety in ques- tion may have certain desirable traits which it might be useful to propagate among farmers. How does one rapidly multiply such seed without relying on expensive, privately run research institutes or, worse, seed multinationals? It is in such circumstances that Dr. R.H. Richharia’s technique of rapid clonal propagation of rice produces stunning results. The technique enables immediate salvage of those rice varieties of which there are very few seeds, or not even one single seed, available. Thus, it is a great tool available to farming communities and gene banks specialising in rice to enable them to rapidly increase their stock of endangered rice seeds. Using the clonal propagation technology, one can easily generate from a single good seed, and that too within 10 months, up to 4,000 kg of pure, pro- ductive rice seeds of the same variety. With this quantity, 80-100 acres can be cultivated in the following season with the same variety. This makes expen- sive duplication of rice seed from central sources or laboratories entirely un- necessary and redundant. Productivity of rice in India and Asia generally has stagnated with the introduction of new dwarf varieties via IRRI and other rice research centres: this is now acknowledged even by IRRI itself in its own publications and scientific papers. The present methods of rice research at such institutes involve identifica- tion of rice cultivars with desirable characteristics, incorporation of desired genes, and their multiplication in laboratories for distribution to farmers. The institutional drawback is that the focus remains on a few varieties. Once these are identified or selected, these are propagated at the expense of those being grown by farmers in their fields. The model of rice research therefore pre- cludes the existence of an alternative system in which farmers themselves select good varieties from their own eco-region and then maintain, sell or otherwise exchange the seeds of such varieties among themselves. Dr. Richharia’s clonal propagation technology was invented to circumvent this problem: it teaches farmers how to raise several kilograms of rice from a single seed and that too within a single season. In fact, it enables an alternative rice research system to develop in which progressive farmers are able to multiply good seed for distribution to other farmers and to thus contribute towards the conservation and development of such varieties. At present, they play no such role since all research into rice and rice varieties is now effectively monopolised by rice scientists. An additional feature of rice propagated by the vegetative method is that 21 0 PART 111: APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY the yields from such rice plants have been confirmed to be much higher than the yields from seed to seed crops. This is an important consideration in adopt- ing the technology on a large scale in the paddies of Asia.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE After the foreign-exchange drought of the 1980s debt crisis, external capital started streaming into several Latin American nations by the end of the dec- ade. But this capital surge is not without its own set of problems in terms of its impact on these developing economies. While the problems posed by large foreign capital inflows are more or less the same for the recipient economies, measures to cope with the capital influx can run the gamut from a predomi- nantly laissez-faire approach to the imposition of quantitative limits. This re- port examines the Chilean response to the capital surge, which can be consid- ered to occupy a position somewhere in between these two extremes. Among the Latin American economies, Chile is a favoured destination for foreign capital. As a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), total capital inflows into Chile averaged 6.2% over the 1990-94 period. Arguably just as important a consideration as the volume of capital flows is the composition of these flows. In this respect, while foreign direct investment (FDI) constitutes REGULATION OF FOREIGN CAPITAL FLOWS IN CHILE 17 the single largest type of inflow into the Chilean economy, a significant por- tion of foreign capital has entered in the form of shorter-term funds (Agosin & Ffrench-Davis, 1996). The latter can essentially be divided into portfolio capital and short-term credits. Portfolio capital, in turn, comprises purchases of debt and equity se- curities such as stocks, bonds and money-market instruments. It is channelled mainly through foreign mutual funds and through offerings of shares of Chil- ean companies on the New York Stock Exchange via American Depository Receipts (ADRs) (Ffrench-Davis et al., 1995). Such investments are typically motivated by the prospect of short-term capital gains and are prone to band- wagon effects, be it in taking positions or in liquidating them (Agosin & Ffrench-Davis, 1996). As such, portfolio investments can hardly be consid- ered as the most stable form of capital flow. Volatility also characterises short-term bank lending, which is based on interest-rate arbitrage. Such flows will come in only if and when the domestic interest rate exceeds the international rate by a margin sufficient to cover the expected depreciation of the recipient country’s currency and the country- specific risk premium. When this condition ceases to hold, the funds can just as suddenly depart for more remunerative climes. Chile has been exposed to the potential of such volatility. Foreign funds made a beeline for Chile from the late 1980s onwards. It therefore had to confront the problems associated with large capital inflows. A major problem is that massive inflows of foreign capital within a short period of time bid up domestic asset prices beyond levels justified by the underlying economic fundamentals. This, in turn, through the positive wealth effect generated, leads to unsustainable increases in consumption and invest- ment. Furthermore, a foreign capital surge entails real exchange rate appre- ciation as demand for the recipient country’s currency rises. It should be noted that much of the short-term capital flowing in is not actually channelled into real, productive investment but rather into specula- tive activities. Not only are these activities, by their nature, volatile and un- predictable but they also do not contribute towards the recipient country’s long-term economic development. These speculative inflows often “produce their own grave-diggers’’ as the resultant real exchange rate appreciation and increase in domestic demand cause a widening current account deficit. Along with the rise in external in- debtedness, this situation adversely affects foreign capital’s perception of the economy’s general creditworthiness. Consequently, when an event triggers a change of investor opinion, foreign funds scramble for the exits, and the out- flow is exacerbated by the herd mentality that characterises international fi- nancial market players. 18 PART I: ECONOMIC POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT To make matters worse, these market agents are not always very sensitive to this risk and, as such, react only when it is too late, when the conditions have deteriorated to the extent that forced external adjustment of some mag- nitude becomes necessary (Le Fort & Budnevich, 1997). The overshooting of asset prices, aggregate demand and the real exchange rate now occurs in the opposite direction, with potentially devastating effects on the domestic economy as the currency plunges alongside asset prices, with a resultant in- crease in the external debt overhang looming over the economy. Such capital surges can further undermine domestic macroeconomic sta- bility by throwing in doubt the feasibility of monetary policy. In the event of high inflation, tight monetary policy, which entails an increase in interest rates to curb excessive spending in the economy, would normally be called for. However, in an environment of unregulated capital flows, this interest-rate rise would lead to the influx of foreign funds attracted by the lucrative returns and greater potential for interest arbitrage. The capital surge, if left unchecked, can wreak damage upon the domestic economy. In short, the use of monetary policy to achieve such an important macroeconomic policy objective as price stability is more or less thwarted due to its impact on external capital flows. Of course, the real exchange rate appreciation (and its deleterious effects on the recipient economy’s competitiveness in international trade and, hence, its current account balance) that results from the capital inflow can be coun- tered by the central bank’s engaging in foreign-exchange-market interven- tion, namely by buying foreign exchange. However, such intervention also serves to raise the domestic money supply, bringing about inflation. Once again, the conflict between the objectives of price stability and external bal- ance manifests itself. A possible solution to this policy dilemma could be in the form of steri- lised intervention, where the inflationary effect of the foreign-exchange-mar- ket intervention is offset by the central bank’s sale of government securities via open-market operations. Consequently, the central bank ends up holding assets that yield the international rate of return and that depreciate in real terms while having to issue liabilities that pay the higher domestic rate and that maintain their real value (Le Fort & Budnevich, 1997). Thus, this meas- ure cannot be sustained on a long-term basis, owing to the losses incurred by the central bank. Another undesirable consequence of massive capital inflows to develop- ing countries lies in how they heighten the vulnerability of the domestic fi- nancial system, which may not be all that well-developed to begin with. Due to the unpredictable nature of short-term capital flows and their being chan- nelled into speculative uses - partly as a result of inadequate prudential super- vision within the domestic financial sector - there is increased deposit volatil- REGULATION OF FOREIGN CAPITAL FLOWS IN CHILE 19 ity as well as foreign-exchange risk (Helleiner, 1997). Moreover, the problem of moral hazard - arising from economic agents’ tendency to “perceive the existence of publicly provided insurance to liabili- ties of financial institutions and institutional investors, whether or not it has been explicitly offered” - further contributes to the assumption of greater risks (Le Fort & Budnevich, 1997). When the speculative bubble bursts, the financial sector will be in danger of going under, being saddled with a consid- erable stock of non-performing loans. It is evident, therefore, that capital surges, while bringing in much-needed funds from abroad that can go some way towards financing a country’s eco- nomic development, can also wreak havoc on the domestic economy. Consid- ering the shortcomings associated with foreign-exchange-market intervention, be it of the sterilised variety or otherwise, some form of regulation of these capital flows appears necessary to sift out the less desirable components of foreign capital while continuing to encourage the entry of long-term produc- tive investments. In this regard, it might be instructive to examine the capital controls in place in Chile, something to which we now turn.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE This paper looks at the process of building and structuring a representa- tive and effective network of organisations of civil society (OCS), out of a diverse collection of groups with little history of working together, to partici- pate in an innovative, time-bound research and advocacy project, based on a partnership with the Ghana Government and the World Bank. Ghana is one of seven countries taking part in a civil society-led Structural Adjustment Par- ticipatory Review Initiative (SAPRI) on the basis of an agreement between an SAPRI: ORGANISING CIVIL SOCIETY TO REVIEW STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT POLICIES 35 international network of OCS, the World Bank and the Governments of the participating countries. SAPRI is basically an exercise in participatory research into the impact of structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) in the selected countries, focusing on a number of agreed issues and policies. It is meant to be a civil society-led exercise. This civil-society leadership is meant to at least balance out the tra- ditional power relations around SAPs in which the Government and World Bank were in charge. The whole exercise is scheduled to last 18 months in each country. At its core is participatory field research by a group of researchers selected by the Government, World Bank and OCS to evaluate the impact of some identified SAP policies, the effects of which the OCS, on one side, and the Government and Bank, on the other, disagree about. The research would be carried out according to a methodological framework agreed by the three parties. The research phase will be sandwiched between processes of broad-based consul- tation and discussion involving mainly actors from civil society. High points of the consultations and dialogue between the three SAPRI partners will be two National Fora: one just before the research stage, which will produce the research issues, and a second, after the research, at which the research find- ings will be presented and discussed. The aims of the SAPRI exercise include: to legitimise local knowledge in the analysis of SAPs, to help local OCS effect national cross-sectoral mobili- sation and form relationships with the Government around economic reform issues,to make space for and institutionalise grassroots involvement in macroeconomic decision-making, and to ascertain how the participation of local, broad-based OCS can improve economic policy-making and produce changes that can lead to significant improvements in people's lives. SAPRI is a product of the many years of rising criticism by civil society groups around the world, especially in developing countries, of the negative impact of World Bank-IMF-designed SAPs on the lives of ordinary people. More immediately, SAPRI is the product of a global network of OCS accept- ing a challenge by World Bank President James Wolfensohn to come forward with suggestions on how the Bank and its critics could jointly evaluate the impact of SAPs. To ensure the comparability of outcomes, the worldwide exercise is guided by Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and Methodological Principles ar- rived at after discussions involving the civil society representatives and World Bank officials. The SOP deal primarily with the organisational dimensions of the exercise while the Methodological Principles concern the research stages. The SOP, among other things, provide for a tripartite national steering com- mittee as well as a tripartite technical committee to oversee the research phase. 36 PART I: ECONOMIC POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT The members of the technical committee will be drawn from the technical committees established by each SAPRI partner. The definition of these prin- ciples involved considerable negotiation; following agreement on these, SAPRI was launched on 14 July 1997. The Accra-based Africa Secretariat of the Third World Network (TWN- Af) was an active participant in this global process. TWN-Af is the Africa regional coordinator within the global civil society network (SAPRIN). Apart from Ghana, Mali, Uganda and Zimbabwe are the other African countries undertaking SAPRI. Ghana’s SAP, initiated in 1983, is the longest-running SAP in Africa. Until recently, it was held up as a model SAP by the World Bank and the other international financial institutions. The implementation of the most funda- mental elements of Ghana’s SAP took place under conditions where criticism of and opposition to any element of the SAP were either dismissed or re- pressed. Since 1992, however, the political situation in Ghana has been consider- ably liberalised under a liberal democratic, multi-party Constitution. There has been an explosion of free expression but concerted expression by all sec- tors of civil society on economic policy matters has not been achieved. Also, despite political liberalisation, the Government’s policy-making process was still heavily imprinted with the less democratic culture of the past years. The challenge of building an effective civil society network was therefore com- pounded by the official policy-making culture.",

In order to communicate the work done on any living thing, the latter has to have a name. We name the members of our families as well as the plants and animals familiar to us in our surroundings. We also name anything that is important to us - harmful or beneficial - no matter where it comes from. The name is the reference point for all other information about the person, plant, animal or inanimate object. It is the identifier in any communication. Local people name the things around them and communicate information on these things to one another in the community. This is what we now call folk tax- onomy and indigenous knowledge. But we also live in a world community, which has developed internation- ally recognised methods of communicating information about ourselves and the world around us. The most universally recognised and uniform of these CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT IN PLANT SCIENCES IN ETHIOPIA 57 communication systems is science. Science is a global language that has evolved since people first started to systematically investigate their surround- ings and organise the resulting information. Modern/European science grew out of the cultures that developed around the Mediterranean Sea, the cultures of the Arabs, Greeks and Romans. Over time, each of the disciplines in sci- ence has developed its own rules for naming and communicating the articles it works with. In the natural sciences, these are all living things, plants, ani- mals and microorganisms, and the borderline viruses. Thus, any scientific study of living things has to use these internationally recognised rules to name and communicate the results of its findings. Conversely, knowing the name of an organism enables a scientist, and anyone else interested, to trace the infor- mation already accumulated about that organism. The science which names living things is called taxonomy or systematics. Lack of an ability to give scientific names to the plant and animal re- sources of a Third World country is a major obstacle to any other basic or applied research and development for those resources. This was the challenge that a group of scientists faced in Ethiopia in the 1970s. How they faced and are overcoming this challenge is the story of building capacity in plant sci- ences in Ethiopia. A second problem addressed by the National Herbarium through the Ethio- pian Flora Project was the editing and publishing of a technical work of con- siderable complexity to an internationally acceptable standard. The Flora and the collection of reference specimens stimulate further taxo- nomic and other scientific research. This, in turn, makes the existing Flora no longer adequate, and it has thus to be revised from time to time. This is why the work of writing a Flora cannot be a one-off event, why there is a need to build a sustainable all-round capacity.",

The coastal zone - the land which extends from the beginning of the coastal plain to the beginning of the continental shelf - occupies only a marginal portion of the country’s territory yet it is home to a disproportionately large section of the population. And the numbers are ever on the increase. It is not only the powerful scenic beauty that this eco-region has to offer which drives people to crowd themselves in these narrow stretches, but the fact that the coastal regions are extremely productive lands hosting nearly a quarter of the earth’s primary plant production, the world’s major spawning INDIA’S POLICY FOR PROTECTING THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT FOR SUSTAINABLE USE 75 grounds and fish nurseries and also some of the most fertile agricultural lands. In addition to farming and fishing - the two major coastal industries - there are several development interests which also show a marked preference for the coastal region. Industries wish to be located there for easy access to the sea for discharge of effluents; thermal power plants, for easy access to the enormous quantities of cooling water they need; tourism promoters want to use the beaches for raising hotels; middle- and upper-class citizens wish to have residential bungalows located there. There are also activities for which foreshore facilities are essential: for example, ports, harbours, jetties, wharves and quays. All these new development pressures are in addition to demands already being made by existing coastal inhabitants. The concentration of development activities on such a scale, in fact, threat- ens to destabilise the very resources that provide the possibilities of living in the coastal belt. The increased economic activities in the region over the past three to four decades have led to the depletion of marine life due to overfishing in coastal waters, the levelling of sand dunes (nature’s first line of defence to protect the hinterland from the ravages of the ocean), the destruction of hun- dreds of acres of mangrove forests and coral reefs, and the ingress of saline water into adjacent freshwater aquifers. In addition, pollutants and toxins ga- lore are emptied daily into the coastal waters as the authorities find it a cheap and easy way to get rid of town and industrial wastes. In India, these pressures would have led to a sharp decline in both the aesthetic and the ecosystem values of such areas and would also have im- pinged negatively on traditionally sustainable economic activities carried out by fishermen and toddy tappers. It is also widely known that tourism develop- ment in several other parts of the world has led to closure of beaches to the local population as the tourism promoters have increasingly privatised these hitherto public resources. Cramming such areas with large numbers of build- ings for tourists has also reduced their tourism value, dissuading people from visiting. The CRZ Notification issued in 199 1 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests seeks to tackle some of these issues and to place any further proposed development within India’s vast coastal stretches within a controlled frame- work.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE The environment of Ethiopia is very varied. The lowest area in the world is a very dry and very hot salt desert in the Afar Depression that is 200 m below sea level. But about 40% of the country’s just over one million km2 of land area is above 1,500 m above sea level, the south-westem parts of which get rain for about 9 to 10 months per year. Over 80% of the water of the River Nile comes from Ethiopia. Agriculture is an age-old activity and Ethiopia is one of the world’s 12 major centres of crop domestication and diversification. But the desperate condition of Ethiopia manifested itself dramatically in the 1984-85 drought and famine when probably more than one million people died. Drought and famine have been a recurring reality over the last few dec- ades. This is the problem which the Conservation Strategy of Ethiopia tried to understand and to develop a set of policies and strategies to deal with, besides dealing also with a new set of problems emanating from efforts at moderniza- tion. Ethiopia’s population, which is the second largest in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria’s, is growing fast. Ethiopia also has the largest livestock popula- tion in Africa, which exerts additional pressure on the renewable natural re- sources. Given this setting, the present methods of resource use and manage- ment, which consist of tapping from nature with little compensatory inputs, are causing serious depletion at an accelerating rate. If unchecked, this could cause a serious impairment of the environment’s ability to keep producing the renewable natural resources to maintain the population, even at its current level of poverty. Human-support capacities The demand for cropland, fuel, timber, forage and browse, which is not compensated for by adequate inputs, e.g. replanting, and in the absence of effective management, is leading to an increasing depletion of the country’s natural vegetation, particularly from pastures, woodlands and forests. In 1984, the annual use of wood was estimated at 24 million cubic metres, some 60% in excess of the sustainable level given the present rate of unaided natural regeneration (FAO, 1988a & 1988b). Even though these estimates seem to have considered only the annual production from high forests, ignoring the biomass produced in woodlands, grasslands, bushlands and agricultural ar- THE CONSERVATION STRATEGY OF ETHIOPIA PROJECT 87 eas, and are thus unduly alarmist, the situation is nevertheless bad. Even the more carefully-based estimates of CESEN-ANSALDO/ FINMECCANICA Group (1986) do not give room for optimism. It should be pointed out, how- ever, that their figures give a standing biomass of more than 14 times the size of the annual production, or an annual production of only 6.9%. Considering that forests with mature trees of much locked up biomass are not extensive in Ethiopia, and considering that much of the present vegetation consists of herbs and shrubs, this proportion should be lower. Since standing crop is easier to determine than the rate of production, it would thus seem that they have un- derestimated the latter. The Ethiopian Forestry Action Program (1993) shows that if appropriate steps are taken, the situation could be reversed within about a decade. While the soils in the Ethiopian highlands have a high inherent fertility, the very low level of fertilizer use to replace the nutrients removed with crops, and the steep and dissected terrain with extensive areas of slopes of over 15%, coupled with the high intensity of rainfall, have led to accelerated soil erosion reaching up to 400 tons/ha/annum. It is estimated (FAO, 1986) that out of the 54 million hectares in the highlands, including Eritrea, serious degradation has occurred in 14 million hectares and moderate degradation in 13 million hectares, while in 2 million hectares the soil has been made so shallow through erosion that crop cultivation is no longer possible. The reduction in soil depth and thus in moisture-holding capacity compounds the problems of drought in those areas of the country where rainfall is low and variable. The major lakes of the country cover 7,000 km2 and have a maximum sustainable yield of fish estimated to be about 35,300 metric tons. Over the past 20 years, the consumption of fish has increased in popularity in Addis Ababa and other urban centres in and around the Rift Valley Lakes area. It is also popular in Bahir Dar on the southern shore of Lake Tana. The catching of fish in the Rift Valley Lakes has more or less kept pace with the increased demand in Addis Ababa. Elsewhere, the fishing potential has hardly been touched, and research and development to support this sector is still in its infancy. However, fish and other aquatic life are beginning to be threatened as industrial development has begun to pollute the water bodies. Livestock production and support capacities Livestock are an integral part of nearly all the farming systems in Ethio- pia. The most important uses of cattle are as draught animals for land prepara- tion in the cereal-growing wetter highland areas and as sources of the staple food, milk, and as accumulated capital in the arid lowland areas inhabited by pastoralist and semi-pastoralist societies. In both cases, small ruminants con- 88 PART II: ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT stitute an important form of capital. There is a steady demand for meat and milk in urban areas. In rural areas, small ruminants are the main suppliers of meat and hides. Hides and skins are second to coffee as major foreign ex- change earners. Livestock numbers, and hence the ability of highland farmers to produce crops, have been severely affected by the recurrent droughts. The deteriorat- ing environmental conditions have also adversely affected feed resources, leav- ing the country’s herds poorly nourished and prone to diseases. Veterinary and other livestock support services have not developed fast enough to cope with these problems. Because the Ethiopian highlands support a large livestock population, the area experiences a severe deficit of animal feed. One estimate (Hurni, 1988) forecasts that all pasture land will be fully utilized by 2005. The demand for cropland has come into increasing competition with that for grazing land. A succession of droughts over the past 20 years has led to catastrophic livestock losses, as well as to a deterioration in the rangelands. The long-term dynamics of rangelands in relation to livestock depletion and recovery are still imperfectly understood. In certain areas, the position has been exacer- bated by the loss of rangelands to large-scale irrigation, to parks and to en- croachment by cultivators, placing increased demands on the remaining rangeland resources (Girma Bisrat, 1990).",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Sugarcane is one of the most significant commercial/cash crops grown by farmers in countries of the South. Farmers plant sugarcane because it receives strong state support; sugarcane factories located in sugarcane-growing areas take up the sugarcane for crushing as soon as it is harvested; and development agencies allocate water resources and electricity connections on a priority basis for those areas growing the crop. Sugarcane cropping is generally admitted to be resource-intensive. Only those farmers who have ready access to cash or credit, irrigation and water supply, fertilizers and pesticides can farm sugarcane. The sugarcane plant re- quires steady irrigation for its growing period of 18 months to 2 years, so 1 04 PART Ill: COMMUNITY-BASED SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS subsistence farmers are unable to farm sugarcane since sole reliance on monsoon supplies is inadequate. Payment for sugarcane also comes in lumps, but only after the harvest has been crushed at a sugarmill. Therefore, only those who can survive on such a system of deferred payments plant this crop. The heavy requirement of water for sugarcane growing is one of the ma- jor question marks hanging over any extension of areas to sugarcane develop- ment. The allocation of such vast quantities of a precious resource to what is actually a privileged crop has had serious negative consequences for agricul- ture as a whole. The example of even well-endowed states like Maharashtra in western India is instructive. Sugarcane in Maharashtra state is the major cash crop, but it is actually grown in drought-prone areas. This has meant the development of expensive artificial irrigation projects. 60% of the water from these projects is now used to irrigate 500,000 hectares of sugarcane-growing land (which amounts to 3% of the cropped area in the state). This means that other crops and non- sugarcane farmers can hope to get little or no water at all. Traditionally, sugarcane is assumed to be a water-guzzling crop: farmers and agricultural scientists have in fact always assumed that the sugarcane crop requires a considerable amount of water to flourish. Therefore, the present or conventional package of practices recommends providing sugarcane fields 100% coverage in terms of water as essential. Farmers are advised to create extensive channels in their fields through which the water can be supplied directly to the roots of plants, flooding them in fact. Since water of this quality and quantity is not going to be available in most places naturally, sugarcane growing requires infrastructure, particularly the erection of resource-demanding large dams, canals and lift irrigation schemes. The resource demands for such large schemes can be troubling, par- ticularly in countries and areas where funds are already scarce and required for more critical areas. Besides its heavy demand for irrigated water supplies, intensive sugarcane farming is ecologically destructive in several documented ways. Artificial ir- rigation often leads to waterlogging and salinity. The continuous, intensive growing of sugarcane in the same plot will generate symptoms associated with soil mining and soil sickness. This is because of the heavy use of syn- thetic fertilisers and pesticides. The use of chemicals leads to a progressive decline in soil fertility since the soil fauna (including earthworms) and microbes are gradually eliminated. The more fertilisers are used, the more water is required. Because of these unhealthy growing conditions, the sugarcane is prone to disease and therefore requires the use of more and more pesticides and fungicides. WATER-EFFICIENT SUGARCANE FARMING 105 Conventional practices recommended to ensure that any pathogens from the standing crop do not contaminate the following crop include completely burning the sugarcane waste in the field, which causes serious air pollution. The practice is unsound because it leads to the unnecessary elimination and waste of significant quantities of organic materials which tropical soils are already deficient in. The other measure followed to dissuade pathogens is maintaining a regular period of fallow between crops every two years. None of these agricultural routines can be said to be a good practice. In Suresh Desai’s scheme of sugarcane planting, most of these practices have been eliminated precisely because they are ecologically harmful, unsustainable in the long term and require a lot of resources. Desai uses very little water compared to farmers elsewhere, yet he is able to maintain yields every year. In addition, he rejects the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides altogether. What Desai has in fact perfected is an organic method of growing sugarcane in which he uses tried and tested farming techniques to replicate a natural growing environment in which sugarcane plants thrive. His innovations will therefore be of enormous interest to farmers everywhere, and all the more so because his methods do not require hefty cash balances or the importation of expensive machinery or non-farm inputs. This good practice is invariably cost- effective and is attractive for precisely that reason.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE The aim of UBINIG’s involvement in the handloom sector was to find a way for the progressive transformation of the sector. While development aid and policies were promoting the growth of an import-dependent and export- oriented garment industry, there was a neglect of the existing local handloom sector. The development planners failed to appreciate the necessity of restruc- turing the traditional home-based industrial activities. Weaving has enormous potential for being an industrial activity and possesses the characteristics of being amenable to transformation. Unfortunately, it did not receive any atten- tion from the government or the so-called development donors. The weavers continued in their occupation only for their survival and livelihood. They had to struggle hard against market forces and the unregulated import and smug- gling of clothes into the market. Started in 1987, UBINIG Tant Prakalpa (UBINIG Weaving Project) pres- ently serves more than 10,000 weavers around the country. The project origi- SMALL-SCALE TEXTILE PRODUCTION USING NATURAL DYES 115 nally started in Tangail as an action research program. Now, it is in operation in Tangail, Pabna, Sirajganj, Kushtia and Cox’s Bazar. Tangail is one of the important centres of the handloom sector. Here, there is a large number of artisan weavers using pitlooms. In the union of Pathrail, of Delduar thana of Tangail district, there are many craft weavers producing fine-quality sarees. The weavers belong to either the Hindu or the Muslim religion. However, the traditional weavers, known as Basaks, belong to the Hindu community. The Basaks are respected for possessing great skill in weav- ing. According to the oral history passed down among the Basak families, Nabab Alibardi Khan brought 25 to 30 Basak families from Murshidabad to cater to the local demand for cloth. These Basaks enjoyed the patronage of the Zamindars, because they produced clothes of fine quality that accorded with the taste of the elite. A large number of Muslim weavers have also been in- volved in this occupation for a long time. Usually, the Muslim weavers switch from farming to weaving when they lose cultivable land or are faced with a situation of poverty. The pitloom weavers project was started in this area pri- marily to address the problems facing the small and poor weavers. The small weavers are the ones having not more than two or three looms per family unit. The weavers carry out the weaving operations with the small amount of capital needed for each production cycle - Tk.3,000 to Tk.4,OOO produces 20 sarees, that is, 120 yards of fabric. The money can be obtained from Mahajans, the capital-owner weavers. Mahajans are also trader weavers. They advance money to the smaller-scale weavers for the products they produce within a particular production cycle. The working capital received from the Mahajan by the weavers is used for purchasing yarn, dyeing and sometimes for jacquard design. The money obtained from the Mahajans as an advance puts the weavers in a disadvantageous position in terms of fixing the price of the finished prod- uct. The Mahajan can decide the price on his own because he has paid in advance. Skilled weavers have greater bargaining power because their prod- ucts fetch a better price in the market, but the semi-skilled and unskilled weavers have to accept the decision of the Mahajan in order to be able to receive fur- ther working capital. Poor weavers want to have a regular flow of income through sales of their product to meet their subsistence needs. Apart from the general developmental thrust, there is one very significant aspect of the handloom weaving project. This is the ecological concern. Handloom weaving activity is not based on the use of fossil fuels. This eco- logical practice is being integrated with the practice of ecological agriculture in the rural areas where the project is in operation. However, although the handloom technology is ecologically-friendly, the dyeing practice in weaving is not. The use of chemical dyes has been a cause 116 PART Ill: COMMUNITY-BASED SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS for concern, for ecological and health reasons. The weavers use VAT and napthol for chemical dyeing of the yarn. These two methods have already been discarded internationally because they use caustic, hydrose, nitric acid and acitic acid for mordanting. Moreover, the chemicals used for the dyes are not Azo-free. The workers who are engaged in dyeing are exposed to various health hazards. They use their hands to mix the chemicals, e.g. mixing acid and napthol in cold water, as a result of which they develop boils. As protec- tion, some of them wear masks over their mouths. According to a worker in a dyeing factory, this work reduces their lifespans by ten years. The waste-water from the dyeing factory gives off a bad smell and pol- lutes the surroundings. The trees and plants get burnt and die gradually. Even as a user of clothes dyed with chemicals, one is at risk of getting skin cancer. The weavers and farmers came together to discuss what could be done to address the problem of the environmental damage caused by the chemical dyeing. In the UBINIG Weavers’ Service Centre, which has a factory of semi- automatic looms to produce various kinds of fabrics, a dyeing unit was set up to provide dyeing support to the weavers. But due to the resultant environ- mental pollution, this could not be continued. An alternative was sought. In 1996, a natural-dyeing unit was set up in a factory located in Nalshoda village of Tangail. A natural-dyeing expert from Laharpur of Chapai Nababganj - a border district in North Bengal -was invited to initiate the dyeing set-up. His name is Tin Kori Das, popularly known as Kori Babu. He showed how natural dye can be extracted from a fruit called Haritoki (Terminalia chebula) and from the wood extract of Khoir (Acacia catechu). As mordant, he used potas- sium dichromate and alum (locally known as Fitkiri). The research on the different sources of natural dyes was initiated alongside the adoption of the technique to make natural dyeing cost-effective.",

How- ever, in upland areas, the use of chemical fertilizers, mainly urea and com- plete fertilizer (NPK), was concentrated largely in vegetable and sweet-po- tato production.

The Green Revolution in the 1970s converted prime agri- cultural lands in so many plain areas of the Philippines to chemical farming.

The search continues for ecologically sound and productive ways of farming. Traditional rice production in almost all parts of the Cordillera is still at the subsistence level. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are extensively used in the plains where commercial production of rice is practiced, and in the vegetable belt. Wet rice production is done in terraced fields with areas rang- ing from a few square meters to about half a hectare. The latter is rare. The rice fields are constructed where there is an assured water source. With the high cost of rice-farming inputs, the degradation of farms brought about by chemical farming and the failure of monocropping, it is relevant now to look at small-scale production practices which have been tested through time. These may seem irreplicable because of changed situations. But with sincere efforts to create the conditions for their practice, there is still hope.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Ethiopia is one of the old centres of agricultural development, and over the millennia, the farming communities created effective systems of land man- agement and agricultural production. The system of governance that existed in Ethiopia for about a millennium preceding the “Scramble for Africa” by European colonizers in the 19th century was feudal, which left land manage- ment entirely in the hands of the local communities supervised by the lower elements of the local aristocracy. These communities had their own statutes, which were, as a rule, orally transmitted and maintained. In the second half of the 19th century, the state started centralizing all power with the aim of developing its capacity to deal with colonialism. It saw local community organization as incompatible with centralized power, and it 146 PART Ill: COMMUNITY-BASED SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS systematically destroyed it. In so doing, it inadvertently dismantled the old systems of land management. Physical soil conservation structures, mostly bunds, ceased to be maintained, and many of them broke down, exacerbating soil erosion. Trees in communal lands were cut down by anybody who wanted the wood. The management of hunting and grazing was discontinued. The environment quickly deteriorated (Environmental Protection Authority, 1 997). This situation was made worse by accelerating population growth. Since the 1960s, the central government has been making some efforts to reverse the situation, but still with a centralized approach. It did not achieve very much that is lasting because the farming communities did not support its programmes. Whenever they could, they pulled up or cut down the trees planted, and destroyed the terraces built, because they identified them with oppression. After the overthrow of the extremely centralist military dictatorship in 1991, the process of decentralizing power started. Even now, however, not all the farming communities everywhere are fully convinced that it is safe to take the initiative in local organization and local decision-making. But with the sustained reassuring encouragement of organs of local government, many farm- ing communities all over the country are taking initiatives to improve their land management and agricultural production systems. Though the negative impacts are still larger than the positive impacts in many areas, this move is clearly for the better. In many areas, in fact, they no longer need any encouragement and are taking their own initiatives independently. Though information passed on from grandparents lives on in the commu- nities, reviving the local community organizations of the past is not always easy. Since the local, national and global social and political scenes have dras- tically changed, a simple imitation of the community organization of the past is no longer appropriate. There are, therefore, new social experiments going on in many communities (e.g. Tenna Shitarek, 1998) to develop local organi- zation and its functioning norms that are effective for the sustainable use of natural resources and for improved agricultural production. It is the effort of three village communities in this respect that is reported in this review.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE In 1976, the export of snake skins from India was banned to protect the ecological role of snakes as rodent predators. The ban left destitute many of the 20,000 Irulas of Tamil Nadu who were the main suppliers of snake skins to the export industries. The Irulas are the aboriginal inhabitants of the plains and scrub jungles of Chinglepet District in Tamil Nadu. Most of these tribals still subsist largely on hunting and food-gathering. Their expertise in hunting THE IRULA TRIBAL SNAKE VENOM EXTRACTION COOPERATIVE 161 deadly snakes is almost legendary. With the ban on the export of snake skins and the snake-skin dealers no longer needing the services of the Irulas, the principal occupation of this largely disadvantaged class of people came to a standstill, almost overnight. Besides rendering a large number of Irulas jobless, the ban also had other serious repercussions, namely a severe shortage of snake venom, which is the most effective cure to treat potentially fatal snake bites. Worldwide, about 30,000 to 40,000 people die annually of snake bite. Of these, 25% or about 10,000 people die in India. The only effective cure for serious snake bites is anti-venom serum made by immunising horses with gradually increasing doses of raw snake venom. Consequently, stocks of snake venom of the medically important species are always needed. In India, the four types of snake that cause the vast majority of fatal bites are the cobra, the krait, the Russells viper and the saw-scaled viper. All these species are found distributed throughout much of the territory of the country. However, snakes are neither easy to find nor easily captured. The Irulas are the only local people in South India with the skills (and the bravery) to catch such poisonous snakes and over the years, they have finetuned their snake-catching techniques almost to perfection. Since under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, all snakes are protected (with the venomous ones being at the top of the list of protected species) and, more especially, since there was a ban on the selling of snake skins since 1976, it was no longer possible for the Irulas to catch snakes without violating the law. Nevertheless, catching snakes in the wild was necessary in the country’s interests because rearing snakes in captivity for the purpose of obtaining venom has proved to be not only expensive but also difficult. Moreover, large num- bers of snakes are needed to collect venom in the quantities required for anti- venom production. Most venom production schemes involve local people who may be specialised snake catchers or tribals involved in the collection of snakes who sell the raw venom or the snakes to the venom laboratory. However, all these schemes imply that once caught, the snakes are kept in captivity for the purpose of extraction of venom till they die. Unfortunately, the snakes, which have an average lifespan of 10-20 years in the wild, would last not more than a few months when kept in captivity. A delicate situation thus arose with the passing of the Wildlife Protection Act. Snake venom was badly needed to produce the anti-venom required to treat potentially fatal snake bites. At the same time, it was necessary to ensure that the snakes that were caught for this purpose were not eventually slaugh- tered for their skins. Moreover, providing venom for medicinal purposes should not result in the snake itself losing its life within a few months as this would also result in the gradual extinction of the venomous species which also hap- 162 PART II I: COMMUNITY-BASED SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS pen to be at the top of the list of protected species of snakes. The Irulas were the only people who were traditionally self-trained and accustomed to catching and handling these venomous snakes. These snake hunters have very few alternative ways of earning a livelihood. Moreover, their respect for wildlife and their knowledge of natural history made them ideal candidates for ensuring that all the above three objectives could be met if combined into a harmonious scheme that would be beneficial both to the Irulas as well as to the society while at the same time not endangering the wild snake population. Thus, the problem was threefold: (a) To ensure that sufficient quantities of snake venom were available. (b) To ensure that the protection given to snakes under the Wildlife Pro- tection Act was in no way compromised, i.e., snakes caught in the wild for purposes of extraction of snake venom needed for medicinal purposes would be released without harm after the venom was ex- tracted. (c) To ensure that the Irula people had a gainful and profitable occupa- tion which at the same time would allow them to nurture the skills that they alone have mastered over the years.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Paper is one of the most essential commodities of modern life, particu- larly for the purposes of communication and other human uses. The use of paper in the countries of the South is still fairly low. Per capita consumption in India, for example, is approximately 3 kg per annum (or less) in compari- son with citizens of the US, Japan and Canada who use between 200-300 kg. HANDMADE PAPER FROM RAGS AND TRASH 173 As industrialisation and its requirements keep on increasing, demand for pa- per and paper products is bound to rise. The problem arises when we look at the raw materials from which conventional paper is made, their sources and the environmental effects of modern paper-making technology. In India, for several decades after independence, paper mills were liberally permitted to use forest stock from virgin forests, including bamboo, as raw material for the manufacture of paper. 70% of the total requirements of pulp for paper was met from forest-based raw materials, wood and bamboo; the remaining 30% came from agricultural residues, including paddy straw, rags and waste paper. To manufacture one tonne of paper board, paper mills require 2.5-3 tonnes of dry forest-based materials. Rates for forest produce destined for such paper mills were set low by forest departments since it was a government policy to support development and industrialisation. After five decades of this kind of development, it is now officially recog- nised that the country’s forest wealth has been severely depleted. Large areas of good forest, particularly bamboo, have been clear-felled and the situation has become aggravated since very little attention was paid to regeneration of forestlands. Forest cover has already come down from 30% in the fifties to around 16% today. Because of this grim scenario, the very survival of several modem paper mills is at stake: a classic instance of unsustainable and eco- logically indefensible development. There is no other choice now but to shift to alternative sources and that too in a fairly big way, if paper needs are to be met. According to a UN study, it will not be possible to raise the four million hectares of additional forest in 15 years to meet wood demand, if seen in the context of present-day planning efforts. However, the depletion of forests is not the only problem associated with paper mills. There are several others: the major chronic problem is the gen- eration of effluents which are highly toxic due to the large quantities of chemi- cals used for treating the raw materials. There is, in addition, the problem of air-polluting emissions as well. Finally, the technology required for large pa- per mills also demands heavy initial capital investment per job of around Rs. 15 to Rs.25 lakhs. (Rs.1 lakh = Rs.100,000). It is in the context of such destruction of forest areas and the necessity of providing low-cost jobs that the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) took on the challenge of manufacturing paper from a variety of non- forestry-based resources. Such materials included cotton rags (in the form of tailor/hosiery cuttings), and small quantities of waste paper as well. Other agro fibres like jute, straw and banana were used for purposes of blending with the primary fibres for mottling effect etc. What is more important, the KVIC also developed appropriate machinery and processes that would be pol- lution-free as well. 174 PART Ill: COMMUNITY-BASED SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS Handmade paper manufactured through the KVIC process has several excellent qualities when contrasted with those of mill-made paper. It is el- egant in appearance and provides an exquisite surface for writing. It has good strength and is practically indestructible: it actually has double the strength of mill-made paper and does not turn brittle with age. It can be used for several artistic and decorative purposes. For these reasons, it fetches a better price than mill-made paper. Today, the handmade-paper industry manufactures different varieties of paper, including drawing paper for artwork, permanent document paper, dark- coloured card sheets, deckled-edged stationery, greeting cards, carry bags, watermarked paper for certificates, filter paper, pads and insulation paper. Output is also used for file covers, duplicating paper and tissue paper. Exports are worth Rs.60 million (1994 figures): these include carry bags, deckle-edged drawing paper and converted stationery. With the interesting technical im- provements available in recent years, and despite its non-glazed appearance, handmade paper can now even be used for four-colour reproduction on offset machines. Once this takes place on a large scale, handmade paper can replace mill products like cartridge paper, bank note and maplitho paper. Being a small-scale industry, the manufacture of handmade paper is to- day an important instrument for the creation of jobs in rural areas. Per job investment ranges from Rs.35,000 to Rs.50,000 depending upon the type of the unit and the variety produced. A large percentage (40%) of these jobs can be, and are, handled by women. The technology used is such that it can be easily repaired if it breaks down. Numerous expert centres are easily avail- able for assistance if required.",

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Tangail is one of the flood-plain zones. Every year, there is overflow of river water to the paddy land, which the farmers consider a source of alluvium to the soil. However, the flood of 1988 was quite disastrous. It lasted for over two weeks and caused damage to houses, crops in the field, livestock, etc. The farmers were badly affected. They approached UBINIG for some support. Though UBINIG had been planning to start working with the farmers, the post-flood situation became an important reason to be directly involved with the farmers in Tangail. The farmers asked for help to be able to cultivate the next crop. The flood occurred in the month of September 1988. The standing crop of Aman was damaged. The seeds for the winter crops were lost. Farm- ers were not able to harvest the crop, and the cultivation of the new crop was uncertain. UBINIG’s involvement with the farmers to solve an immediate problem led it deeper into the issue of the crisis of modern agriculture. In working with the farmers, UBINIG came to know that it was not only the flood which posed a great problem for the farmers, but also the practice of so-called modern agriculture, which had created a crisis. To get a more com- prehensive understanding of how farmers perceive chemical-based agricul- ture, UBINIG undertook a study in 1989-90. Through discussions with farm- ers individually and in groups, a wealth of information was collected. This comprised primarily the perceptions of the farmers through their experience with modern agriculture. The first three important points raised by the farmers were the following: (a) The fertility of the soil was clearly declining. (b) The land was not as fertile as it used to be before. More and more fertilizer was required every year. It did not yield the same level of crop yield. (c) The health situation was worsening. The nutrition level was lower. There were many diseases, such as gastric, skin diseases and respira- tory diseases, and many health problems faced by women in childbearing. NAYAKRISHI ANDOLON: A COMMUNITY-BASED SYSTEM OF ORGANIC FARMING 185 The strongest complaints against chemical-based agriculture came from women. Every peasant woman complained about her health and the health of her children. The greatest of the problems were the effects of pesticides, which caused ecological and health problems. Moreover, pesticides were seen as a killer of human beings, as they were used for committing suicide as well as to murder women. The other issues which caused concern to the farmers were: (a) The fish populations in the bodies of water and ponds were declining in quantity and diversity. Most of the local varieties had disappeared. The frog population had also declined alarmingly. There were even, the farmers noticed, no leeches in the water anymore. (b) Pest attacks in the fields became more widespread and intense. Most of the pests were new varieties. Old farmers claimed they had never seen before many of the pests they now encountered in the fields. (c) There was a general decline in livestock and poultry populations. The reason was not economic poverty, but the lack of biomass production caused by HYV rice. The local varieties had been the main source of fodder. In the absence of the local variety, straw from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) variety of rice failed to meet the need for livestock feed in terms of quality and quantity. (d) There were fewer birds in the village as well as very few bees, butter- flies and other insects. The fruit trees flowered in the season but the quantity of fruit farmers could eventually harvest was very low. In some seasons, the harvest was almost nil. (e) There was a general degradation in the sources of nutritionally im- portant food. This was mainly because farmers were not producing pulses and oilseeds in the face of overwhelming HYV cultivation of rice and wheat. The farmers realised that the total income of the family declined, both in value and in quantity. In the calculation of benefits from HYV varieties, farm- ers quickly realised that calculating productivity and income on the basis of a single crop is faulty and misleading. These were the perceptions of the farmers that led them to search for new ways of food production. Initially, the peasant women took the lead in stop- ping the use of pesticides. This was mainly for health reasons. This experi- ence was extremely important for UBINIG. Soon, a group of farmers organ- ised themselves and started to experiment with green manure and compost. The compost, made of water hyacinth, as the main biomass source became quite popular. Water hyacinth is available in plenty. This was the first break- through in the sense that the initial group of farmers became convinced that 186 PART IV: ENVIRONMENTALLY-SOUND PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES they did not need to depend on pesticides and chemical fertilisers. Soon, the practice of Nayakrishi Andolon spread among the farmers from village to village. It was not an individual act, it was a community-based programme. Therefore, Nayakrishi Andolon emerged in response to the negative con- sequences generated by chemical agriculture and involved the men, women and children of the community in organising to produce healthy food, a healthy environment and a happy life. This happiness, or, as the farmers call it, ananda, is both material and cultural and must be grasped as the living experience of a social being within a community.",

GENERAL INFORMATION 1.1 Title of practice or experience SIBAT Training farmers to regain traditional seeds I .2 Category of practice/experience and brief description As implemented by the Philippine-based Sibol ng Agham at Teknolohiya or SIBAT (Wellspring of Science and Technology), community seedbanking has begun to help farmers in at least five regions in the Philippines regain access and control over what SIBAT calls the “heart and soul” of farm pro- duction - seeds. SIBAT, a non-government organization formed in 1984, has since been advocating for sustainable agriculture and farmers’ control over their land and other resources. The main goal of community seedbanking is to restore the traditional, indigenous or endemic seeds a community has been cultivating for genera- tions. The reason is that traditional seeds require no chemical inputs, now blamed for the degeneration of farmlands in many parts of the world. One basic requirement of this effort is training farmers to determine the source and characteristics of their seeds. Determining the source enables farmers to find out for themselves the environment from which the seed was derived (i.e., upland, lowland, including climatic conditions). Characteristics include yield, resistance or vulnerability to pests, crop duration, and, in grains such as rice and corn, color, aroma, texture and taste. Oriented on the science and art of determining the characteristics of each variety, these farmers can now program their cropping pattern. They know what type of seed is pest-resistant or which seed variety can withstand drought. With this knowledge, trained farmers know what varieties to plant during particular seasons of the year. Seeds that SIBAT’s farmer-beneficiaries now have under their control SIBAT: TRAINING FARMERS TO REGAIN TRADITIONAL SEEDS 215 include grains such as rice, corn, peanuts and legumes. They also have seeds of vegetables such as squash, eggplant, and ampalaya or bitter gourd, tomato and yams, among other endemic crops. 1.3 Name of person or institution responsible for the practice or experience Sibol ng Agham at Teknolohiya (SIBAT) I .4 Name and position of key or relevant persons or officials involved Ms Victoria Lopez, Executive Director 1.5 Details of institution",

Ethiopia is an agricultural country, with about 85% of the population being rural (Environmental Protection Authority, 1997). In the varied and variable Ethiopian environment, a single agricultural system based on a single crop or even a small number of crops would be totally inad- equate and agriculture would be stillborn if it depended on monocultures. Conversely, modern agriculture based on monocultures is being successfully adopted only in the not-so-extensive flat areas with homogenous environ- ments, which either have high rainfall or can be irrigated. The environmentally and culturally/ethnically variable Ethiopia thus needs a commensurate genetic diversity, and the genius of its farming communities has produced the answer.

    "abstract": "PRACTICE/INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCE Though the problems addressed by this note about vermitech are diverse, the technology described herein is the basic process that enables people to raise earthworms. Essentially, many domestic residents, residential colonies, village organisations, and even town and city municipalities and industrialists face acute problems concerning the disposal of organic wastes generated by them either in the kitchen or in the factory sites. The treatment of such wastes using chemicals or other technological processes like incineration is not only expensive, but also requires a great deal of expertise and trained manpower. Not only that, it also harms the environment and is a danger to public health. Garbage or organic wastes produced by every home make up the munici- pal or corporation garbage which today is a growing environmental problem. Composting can convert all such wastes into wealth. Every home or munici- pality can vermicompost its organic wastes after predigestion without the need to transport such wastes over long distances for disposal. This is an environ- ment-friendly technique entailing no pollution whatsoever. Hence vermicomposting is a more sustainable technique for solid-waste disposal, compared to the conventional methods like landfilling, incineration, biogas production and composting by the efflux of time. Nutrients in earthworm cast- ings are predigested and hence are readily soluble in water for uptake by plants. Earthworms are today being successfully used for the purpose of treating a wide variety of organic wastes. Though scientists recommend two to three species of earthworms the world over, Dr Ismail recommends native species of earthworms for the said purpose. The other major objective of using earthworms is to improve the fertility and the condition of the soil. Earthworm pits, containers or sheds eventually generate a large quantity of enriched vermicompost which can be worked into the soil to improve it. Worm-worked soils are conspicuously different from soils devoid of earthworms. Moreover, the tunnels formed by the worms aid in the passage of water which also washes the nutrients from earthworm chan- nels to the plant roots that extend quite rapidly along these channels. RAISING OF EARTHWORMS (VERMITECH) FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY-SOUND USES 245 The present practice described here is basically a low-cost method of main- taining and multiplying local varieties of earthworms so that a large popula- tion of them is made available for the problems or situations described above. It is still necessary and desirable to harness the potential of several other sur- face and sub-surface species of local varieties of earthworms. These efforts, in fact, will realise the desired goals in improving the soil faunal component of a given soil ecosystem. Vermitech is a worm-powered technology of not only applying earthworms to organic wastes for production of compost but also introducing earthworms into the soil for bioremediation of the soil. This is the most natural, ancient and perhaps the best among all sustainable agricultural practices.",

    "abstract": "The 1994 Barbados Conference was particularly pointed in identifying the complex interplay of factors that contributed to the scale on which \"waste management\" had become a horrend- ous problem for SIDS. Among those factors were the shortage of land areas and resources for safe disposal of wastes, population growth, growing consumerism and the increase in imports of polluting and hazardous substances. The price of economic and social progress was a devastating build-up of a wide range of wastes both from intensive agricultural production, effluents from manufacturing or tourist resorts and wanton disposal of a growing array of consumer items. More disturbing perhaps, was the threat to human health and a reoccurrence of communicable diseases from the inadequacies of waste disposal systems, including the disposal of human waste. An understanding of the magnitude of waste management problems, with their increasing pressures on the carrying capacity of SIDS will require constant monitoring, analysis and government support. All of this requires adequate equipment, sound expertise, effective policy instruments and a conscious public committed to re- duction, reuse and recycling of waste. Against this array of forces, a de- termined effort to pursue improved management of waste through strategic interventions involving government, private sector and community initia- tives was undertaken by a quasi- statutory agency in Trinidad and Tobago in the early 1980's: The role played by this agency has provided a significant source of knowledge and expertise which are being drawn upon to assist other countries in the Caribbean. 12 SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES",

    "abstract": "Coastal resource management issues cannot be addressed effectively by technocrats alone. To be sustainable, it is essential for persons living in coastal communities to be actively involved in and to take responsibility for the management of their coastal resources. The intervention of the Grenada Community Development Agency (GRENCODA) in Beausejour illustrates the role of an intermediary development agency as a catalyst for community based action. It demonstrates that effective community action requires commitment on the part of the facili- tating/intermediary agency as well as on the part of the target community in order to achieve successful initiatives for sustainable development. GRENCODA embarked on a project to work with selected coastal communities on the leeward side of Grenada to address issues which affected them. Thirteen communities were initially involved in the project. Beausejour was the first target comm- unity and the one which responded most quickly to the GRENCODA initiative which came at a time when residents in the community were seriously concerned about coastal erosion. GRENCODAs intervention helped the community to become more aware of how unbridled sandmining, dumping of solid waste and lack of coastal conservation practices had led to the destruction of the coastline, the mangrove, the reef and consequently to a decline in fishing activities. Their collective action had dramatic results which encouraged the community to take greater responsibility for building a more sustainable future for themselves using resources of their ecosystems and environment. The work of GRENCODA also highlights how the activity of an NGO can complement macro-policy initia- tives. In the early 1990's, Governments of the OECS began to be more aware of the destructive impacts of beach sand- mining and took an official policy stance 26 SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES in this regard.

Also, negative social and cultural consequences such as illegal drugs and prostitution have assumed disturbing proportions. There are strenuous efforts on the part of governments, the private sector, citizens organisations and hotel associations to redress those deficienc- ies.

It is in this regard that the Pinelands Creative Workshop (PCW) in Barbados exemplifies a group that has worked consistently within its comm- unity and with others to promote ideas of self-reliance positive self-esteem and community cohesion, as well as an alternative mode of community govern- ance which stresses community self- awareness and self-reliance. The PCW’s main tool is culture - popular theatre and dance, are used to stimulate community reflection and promote togetherness. The PCW has used its cultural product, not only as a tool for education, but also as a means of generating income which enables the group itself to be self sustaining and places it in a better position to promote development in its community. The dynamic and committed leadership, operating in a flexible structure, has contributed significantly to the success of the group. Through its outreach activities, the PCW has not only had an impact on the lives of the people in the Pinelands community, but has also helped to promote concepts of sustain- able community action throughout Barbados.",

    "abstract": "SECTION 2.3 [l0) - MICRO - ENTERPRISES Micro - Enterprises and Sustainable Development Through Human Resource Development: Fairfield Pottery Co. Introduction Sustainable development in the English- speaking Caribbean has to mean much more than an article of faith. From this perspective, it has to be made meaning- ful for all social groups and strata in the region. In this regard too, it has to embrace individuals at their current levels of social development and income generating capacity, while enhancing their standard of living and social condition. Sustainable development therefore does not necessarily have to be associated with doing more with less; it can also mean doing more with the same quantum of natural resources. It is in this context that the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) through its Caribbean Technology Consultancy Services (CTCS) Network has strongly influenced the development of the social lives of persons engaged in the micro- enterprise sector in the English- speaking Caribbean, providing them with the necessary technical skills through hands-on training, and the dissemination of related technical information. It has made a crucial contribution in this regard with respect to the small enterprise and small-scale manufacturing sectors, in the use of a relatively abundant natural resource found throughout the region - clay. A more optimal use of the clay resource, the talents of several hitherto relatively unskilled and low-end producers of pottery in the region, and the necessary technical training introduced through the CDB, have been brought together. The results have been the creation of products of higher added value, not only in terms of quality, but also regarding such attributes as aesthetics, and uniqueness.",

Taken in con- junction with the all-pervasive and penetrating influence of global econ- omic and technological forces on all aspects of life, in even the smallest and most remote communities of SIDS, the mobilising of human resources as social and intellectual capital, assumes add- itional significance. It is therefore both encouraging and informative to learn of experiences in SIDS, which successfully pursue a path of development, at the centre of which is an enhanced entrepreneurial capacity to meet the powerful challenges of globalisation and trade liberalisation. In this regard, the efforts of the Belize Institute of Management are portrayed to illustrate how the factors of size and scale become opportunities for im- proved management capacity.",

Among the interesting features of the study are the interactions between technical co-operation agencies, the management of an S&T institution in a developing country, the scope for applications of technological innova- tions in relation to market size and social costs of farm production, along with the strengthening of indigenous technical expertise and the commercialisation of waste management technology. In this regard, the experiences of the SRC, originating in 1978, provide useful information on creative strategies deployed by a national institution to address several of the Priority Areas identified in the Programme of Action (POA) of the Global Conference on Small Island Developing States, held in Barbados in 1994. The issues addressed also demonstrate cross-sectoral linkages between farm production, animal waste, household needs of rural communities, the de- mands of alternative energy usage on account of economic factors and also the growing requirement to reduce pollu- tion from agro-industrial waste.",

    "abstract": "One of the most critical demands for SIDS is the on-going enhancement of a scientific and technological capacity which can effectively draw on tradi- tional knowledge and, at the same time, pursue creative adaptation of R&D from imported technologies of the North. The need for information exchange and technology transfer among and between scientific institutions of the South pre- sents a major challenge to existing forms of functional co-operation available to SIDS. The heavy economic costs of R&D make it even more pertinent for appropriate mechanisms and national policies to foster exchanges of personnel and multi-disciplinary approaches in attempting to build S&T capacity within SIDS. In this regard, the strengthening of regional and sub-regional institutions will be expected to play an innovative role in ensuring that there is value added and concrete prospects for the scaling-up of activities by national R&D institutions. For Caribbean SIDS, a resource of enormous potential for technical co- operation in S&T exists in the Caribbean Council for Science and Technology (CCST), with its almost twenty years of training and research experience. From the wide variety of areas in which it has promoted collaborative R&D initiatives, recent advances in approaches to water resources management from an in- tegrated perspective, will be examined in this case-study. Given the growing awareness of the pivotal role of water in regard to the critical demands of tourism and agriculture, as well as for the social sectors of health, sanitation and consumer affairs, the issues addressed will have far reaching consequences for sustainable human development, in the Caribbean and beyond.",

    "abstract": "In advocating attention to the environ- mental implications of sustainable development, there is a tendency to place emphasis on the degradation and adverse effects on societies’ natural and physical resources. As important as this may be, neglect of the relations between the social factors and the productive use of natural resources can give rise to preservation and conservation of the environment at the risk of not satisfying human needs. One of the most basic of human needs is the ability to earn one’s livelihood in a dignified and self-fulfilling manner. However, it is increasingly apparent that a great majority of persons in the younger age groups of developing societies are facing the stark reality that not only are high levels of unemploy- ment endemic in their societies, but also the educational systems have failed to provide skills and competencies by which they might be considered employable. Moreover, traditional sectors,such as agriculture, are declining in their contribution to the economic growth and where limited opportunities for employment do exist, the demand is for technical and managerial know-how and experience. The demands of sustainable human development must therefore be addressed in relation to questions of imparting skills, particularly for the large proportion of unemployed youths, in ways that make it possible to realise their potential and contribute mean- ingfully to the future of society. In its attention to environmentally sound management of land resources, the SIDS POA explicitly linked the need for new and improved technologies in agriculture to the opportunities for absorbing labour and employment creation, with a view to reducing poverty. By outstanding leadership and commitment to farming as a com- mercially viable option for a sustainable livelihood, the work at the Gilbert ~~~~ ~ 220 SHARING INNOVATIVE EXPERIENCES Agricultural and Rural Development Centre (GARDC) has become a model experiment in vocational and technical education. This brief account. of the Centre's philosophy, organisation and manage- ment could usefully facilitate its adaptation and application to small societies in the Caribbean and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The Future Centre Trust (FCT) represents a comprehensive effort towards promoting sustainable deve- lopment on the island of Barbados. Priority actions identified under the SIDS POA, can be interpreted as being discrete areas of activity towards sustainable development. However, the FCT made a conscious effort towards integrating all areas of its work including the advocacy of sustainable agriculture, environmental protection, provision and dissemination of environmental information, promotion of organic food, support for organic farming, and the encouragement of alternative medicine through the use of herbs. The mission of the FCT was shaped by the emerging social and environmental issues facing Barbados in the early 1990s. In 1961, the United Nations identified Barbados as a model of good environmental management. Today, the country scores high on the Human Development Index and has a relatively high GDP per capita, but this has been achieved at high costs in other deve- lopmental spheres. The social cost associated with the production of these ”favourable” indices is not necessarily reflected in the price of goods and services produced. The GDP figures at best, mask the total economic and environmental cost of producing that level of effort. Waste generation is an obvious example, it has been estimated that in Barbados 70% of the waste matter generated can be composted and another 25% can be recycled, but this does not take place. Instead disposal through landfills have been the norm. Sewage and effluent flowing to the south and west coasts have contributed to the degradation of nearly 75% of the coral reef on those coasts. Coral reefs and beaches are important elements of the country’s natural resources in terms of maintaining its attractiveness as a tourist destination. Today most fresh water springs in Barbados are threat- ened by garbage, faecal matter and in particular, agricultural contaminants leaching into the underground aquifers. A higher level of environmental aware- ness and incentives are needed to stimulate and effect the required behavioural changes to combat these negative developments. It is against this background that the emergence of an organization aimed at promoting sustainable development the Future Centre Trust - is so relevant, especially in terms of the country’s development. Despite its other efforts, perhaps at this time, the greatest contribution of the FCT is its assistance to the development and implementation of public awareness and education programmes, which are designed to gain local recognition of the need to control waste at its source, and to convert it appropriately.",
